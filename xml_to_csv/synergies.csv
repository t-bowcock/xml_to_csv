329,726,"- {{Dlc|r}}{{C|Tainted Azazel}}: The same effect as Brimstone, dealing full damage (Tainted Azazel's default laser damage is halved unless Hemoptysis is used first). Tainted Azazel can no longer use Hemoptysis.<br>"
329,528,"- Angelic Prism: While the tear is in contact with the prism, it will fire 4 additional tears in cardinal directions at Isaac's tear rate.<br>"
329,506,- Backstabber: Much easier to inflict bleeding and double damage on most enemies.<br>
329,704,- Berserk!: The tear can't be controlled while berserking but it can be batted around the room until the effect ends.<br>&emsp;- {{C|Tainted Samson}}: uses a passive form of Berserk! that works the same way.<br>
329,118,"- Brimstone: Tear takes the shape of a very large laser ring. {{Dlc|nr}} The shot speed is ignored. The Tears stat is ignored and the damage is dealt very rapidly at a rate equivalent to 1 tear delay. This ring will always be present and doesn't need charging up like normal Brimstone would.<br>&emsp;- '''Brimstone''' + Incubus: Incubus' Brimstone laser is not affected by Ludovico Technique.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- {{Dlc|r}} Adds a smaller controllable laser ring in addition to the main one.<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|r}} '''Brimstone''' + Ipecac: +2 damage, beam explodes when colliding with enemies and obstacles.<br>&emsp;- '''Brimstone''' + A Lump of Coal: The ring increases in diameter, but not the damage, the farther away it gets from Isaac.<br>&emsp;- '''Brimstone''' + Spoon Bender: The ring reaches out to attack enemies near it, reforming into a ring when no enemies are present.<br>&emsp;- '''Brimstone''' + Technology: The ring is visually identical to a normal Brimstone ring, but the 1.5x damage multiplier applies.<br>&emsp;- '''Brimstone''' + 20/20/The Inner Eye/Mutant Spider: no effect.<br>"

329,373,"- Dead Eye: Damage bonus increases until it hits the max of 2x. Since the controllable tear never hits the ground or wall, the bonus cannot be lost.<br>"
329,52,"- Dr. Fetus: A bomb is shot out at high speed and can be controlled, another bomb cannot be shot until the previously shot bomb has detonated.<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|r}} Causes your tears to act like Epic Fetus and now inherits all synergies Epic Fetus has.<br>"
329,572,"- Eye of the Occult: While holding a direction key, the Ludovico tear will constantly shoot out controllable tears in random directions. The air time of these tears scales with the range stat.<br>"

329,418,"- Fruit Cake: The tear will cycle through different effects, based on Isaac's tear rate.<br>&emsp;- (Added in Afterbirth+, Removed in Repentance) If Isaac stays in one room long enough the Ludovico tear will often fill the room with many stationary Trisagion tears that last until Isaac leaves the room. This combination can easily clear most rooms.<br>"
329,331,"- Godhead: The tear homes towards nearby enemies and gains a large damaging aura. However, the aura cannot damage an enemy that is in contact with the actual tear; barring a high tear rate, it may be better to keep the aura on the enemies instead of the tear.<br>"
329,374,- holy light: The Ludovico tear will release holy beams on itself periodically while touching an enemy.<br>
329,360,"- Incubus|anr: Isaac gains a controlled tear while also being able to shoot normally with Incubus. Incubus's tears gain piercing and spectral properties.<br>&emsp;- (Added in Repentance) Incubus creates a second smaller Ludovico Technique tear instead, which can both be controlled by Isaac. The second tear is slightly delayed/ outside of the main tear. This may cause it to not hit enemies sometimes.<br>&emsp;- (Added in Repentance)  {{C|Lilith}}:  Lilith's incubus will fire a smaller Ludovico Technique tear. For each doubled incubus caused by Box of Friends, there will be an additional Ludovico Technique tear that spawns on Lilith's location.<br>"
329,444,"- Lead Pencil|a+nr: The tear blinks red, but the effect is entirely cosmetic.<br>&emsp;- (Added in Repentance) Tear barrages are launched in cardinal directions, even when not controlling the tear. Proc rate depends on fire rate.<br>"

329,213,- Lost Contact: Tear will block enemy tears without disappearing.<br>

329,55,- Mom's Eye: The Ludovico tear has a chance on each damage tick to fire a smaller tear in a random direction. This chance scales with luck and goes up to 100% at 10 Luck.<br>
329,217,- (Removed in Afterbirth+) Mom's Wig: The item causes spiders to spawn rapidly when moving the tear.<br>&emsp;- (Added in Repentance) Causes Spiders to rapidly spawn until the cap of 5 is reached.<br>
329,229,- Monstro's Lung: Tear turns red and does more damage.<br>&emsp;- (Added in Afterbirth) Tear becomes a cluster of variously sized tears spread over a small area. The tears move at the same speed when controlled but constantly move around each other.<br>
329,317,- Mysterious Liquid: Creep continuously oozes from underneath the tear.<br>
329,5,"- My Reflection: The shot speed multiplier causes the tear to move significantly faster, allowing it to catch up to any fast-moving enemies.<br>"
329,104,- The Parasite: Shoots out smaller tears when attacking an enemy. Scattered tears are spectral and piercing.<br>
329,478,"- Pause: The tear deals damage, even if the enemies are stopped. Moving the tear unpauses the enemies.<br>"
329,315,"- Strange Attractor: Enemies, items and even most bosses will be sucked to the single floating tear, dealing constant damage while keeping Isaac well away from harm, making this combination extremely effective in almost all scenarios.<br>"

329,68,"- Technology: The tear becomes a large laser ring, which visually looks like a shot fired by Tech X|n. Shot speed is ignored. The Tears stat is ignored and the damage is dealt very rapidly at a rate equivalent to 1 tear delay.<br>"
329,395,"- Technology: The tear becomes a large laser ring, which visually looks like a shot fired by Tech X|n. Shot speed is ignored. The Tears stat is ignored and the damage is dealt very rapidly at a rate equivalent to 1 tear delay.<br>"
329,244,"- Tech.5: The tear controls as usual, and Isaac fires the laser towards the tear relative to his position, rather than in the direction the player is moving the tear.<br>"
4,706,- Abyss: When Isaac uses Abyss to absorb Cricket's Head it turns into a larger red locust dealing triple Isaac’s damage per tick.<br>
304,704,"- Berserk!: For some reason, as you gain more kills while berserk, Libra steadily increases the damage, tears, and range stat with seemingly no limit, allowing massively high DPS, but targets are much more difficult to hit as the range of the swing gradually extending outwards more and more with each kill.<br>"
304,330,"- Soy Milk: As tear delay is valued very highly by the formula, greatly increases all stats.<br>&emsp;- (Added in Repentance) Soy Milk is only a minor DPS upgrade, and as such a very minor all stats up.<br>"
304,149,- Ipecac: Can be rapidly fired with decreased damage.<br>
304,562,"- Rock Bottom: Stats will increase as a result of items, get locked at the highest point, and then be balanced out via Libra allowing items like Ipecac and Soy Milk to have higher damage/shot speed respectively.<br>"
304,299,"- Taurus: Gradually increases all stats in an incomplete room. Libra prevents Isaac from becoming invincible (unless with high stats), and stat increases will remain until the end of the fight.<br>"
304,439,"- {{T|Tape Worm}}: As range is valued very highly by the formula, greatly increases all stats. Synergizes well with Mom's Box.<br>&emsp;- (Added in Repentance) Tape Worm is a flat +3 range instead of x2, resulting in only a small all stats up.<br>"

116,522,"- telekinesis|r the active item can be reactivated the moment the previous charge stops, making it always active<br>"
63,382,"- Friendly Ball|force=r: Walking over a captured enemy will double charge the ball, allowing the enemy to be released, and allowing to catch a new one in the same room, and the process repeats. This allows the Friendly Ball to be used much, ''much'' more often, and gathering many more friends. Note: trying to catch a new enemy while the old one is in the process of spawning will result in the ball phasing through, catching nothing, thus wasting charge.<br>"
63,147,- {{Dlc|r}} Notched Axe: Causes remaining charge from the previous floor to carry over to the next one.<br>
180,495,- Ghost Pepper: Poison farts shoot a fire behind Isaac.<br>

254,229,- Monstro's Lung: Effect is applied every time you shoot.<br>
254,595,"- Saturnus: Orbiting tears will be the same as the last fired tear before leaving the previous room. To guarantee orbiting tears with the Blood Clot damage bonus, your last fired tear before leaving a room must come from the left eye.<br>"
254,152,"- Technology 2: As the laser from Technology 2 occupies your right eye, all tears now fired from the left eye have the statistical benefit of Blood Clot applied.<br>"
254,358,"- The Wiz: Blood Clot applies on both eyes, meaning the second shot from either eye will always be a Blood Clot shot. It will randomly alternate which shot of the two eyes counts for the other's Blood Clot shot if you fire multiple tears per shot like with Cursed Eye.<br>"
157,619,"- Birthright + {{C|Samson}}: Birthright allows him to gain 4 more damage boosts at the same +0.2 intervals, for a new maximum total of +14.0.<br>"

The beam will also gain random worm trinket effects.<br>&emsp;- Increasing tears stat will increase damage and width brimstone as well.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- Damage per Tick = Damage × Fire Rate ÷ 5<br>"
118,443,"- {{Dlc|nr}} Apple! / Euthanasia / Tough Love: The beam can gain the damage multiplier from each of the items, although there is no visual difference. The bonus applies for the whole beam and not on a per-tick basis. Euthanasia loses its instant kill ability, however.<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|r}} The bonus applies randomly on every tick of the beam, including the insta-kill ability from Euthanasia.<br>"
118,496,"- {{Dlc|nr}} Apple! / Euthanasia / Tough Love: The beam can gain the damage multiplier from each of the items, although there is no visual difference.

Euthanasia loses its instant kill ability, however.<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|r}} The bonus applies randomly on every tick of the beam, including the insta-kill ability from Euthanasia.<br>"
118,222,"- Anti-Gravity: An orb of energy expands, then shrinks while firing the beam after a delay. The orb still hurts enemies if they touch it. Isaac can start charging a new shot immediately after releasing the fire key without canceling the first shot, effectively allowing for a faster firing rate. It makes it harder to hit enemies with {{C|Azazel}} as the beam does not increase in range. {{Dlc|r}} Size and damage of the beams no longer scale with fire rate as well as lasting infinitely at above 15 fire rate.<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|r}} Anti-Gravity + Soy Milk / Almond Milk: Allows auto firing upon full charge but without permanent beam uptime.<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|anr}} Anti-Gravity + Incubus: Isaac will fire Brimstone orbs, while Incubus will fire regular Brimstone beams.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- {{Dlc|r}} Both Isaac and Incubus fire Brimstone orbs.<br>"

118,431,"- Multidimensional Baby: If a brimstone laser is shot through the baby, it will double the laser.<br>"
118,572,- Eye of the Occult: Fires automatically upon reaching full charge. The beam curves towards the crosshair and then attempts to hit the wall Isaac is facing.<br>
118,531,- Haemolacria: +20 Tear Delay after Haemolacria's tears down. Tears burst into 4-7 Brimstone beams that do Isaac's damage per tick.<br>&emsp;- {{C|Azazel}}/ {{C|Tainted Azazel}}: Overrides these characters' Brimstone. Tears do not burst into Brimstone beams.<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|r}} Double Brimstone: Grants +1 Damage but not the 1.2x damage multiplier. The width of the beams doubles.<br>&emsp;- Haemolacria + Chocolate Milk: The Brimstone beams deal full damage regardless of charge.<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|r}} Haemolacria + Technology: The lasers coil the beams. This is purely visual and does not grant a 1.5x damage multiplier.<br>
118,726,- Hemoptysis: Enemies hit by the sneeze will gain a curse that increases the damage Brimstone deals to 2x and +3 flat damage. Enemies who die to Brimstone under the curse will damage and spread the curse to nearby enemies.<br>

118,329,"- The Ludovico Technique: The Ludovico Technique has priority. The beam forms a large ring that is controllable and does not need to be charged. The damage is dealt 15 times per second, unaffected by Tears. Enemies inside the ring without touching it are not hurt.<br>&emsp;- The Ludovico Technique + multi-shot effect: No effect.<br>&emsp;- The Ludovico Technique + C Section: Disables C Section. Fetuses no longer spawn.<br>&emsp;- The Ludovico Technique + Incubus:<br>&emsp;&emsp;- {{Dlc|nr}} Incubus' Brimstone laser is not affected by Ludovico Technique.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- {{Dlc|r}} Adds a smaller controllable laser ring in addition to the main one.<br>&emsp;- The Ludovico Technique + A Lump of Coal: The ring increases in diameter when Isaac is further; 100% when he is on the center, 1.25x when he is 12.5 tiles of distance away.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- {{Dlc|nr}} The damage does not increase on distance.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- {{Dlc|r}} The damage increase 20% per tile of distance.<br>&emsp;- The Ludovico Technique + Mom's Knife: Overrides Brimstone.<br>&emsp;- The Ludovico Technique + Proptosis: The ring increases in diameter when Isaac is closer; 1.25x when he is on the center, 100% when he is 12.5 tiles of distance away.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- {{Dlc|r}} The ring deals 1.5x Isaac's Damage at its largest, and 50% at its smallest.<br>"
118,132,"- A Lump of Coal|force=a: The beam gradually increases in size and damage the farther it travels, with the damage increasing on a multiplier that is +20% per tile of distance. This allows for a huge damage increase from longer distances.<br>"
118,55,- Mom's Eye: Adds a chance to shoot a beam from the back of Isaac's head.<br>
118,114,"- Mom's Knife: Mom's Knife has priority. Does not apply Brimstone's tears down. Adds a small barrage of knives after the main knife is fired, with each knife doing {{Dlc|nr}} 80% of /{{Dlc|r}} 2x Isaac's tear damage. This effect does not work with {{C|Azazel}}'s Brimstone.<br>&emsp;- The barrage of knives goes all the way across the screen and does not return.<br>&emsp;- Charge amount increases the barrage size; 2-4 knives at 0%, 8-10 knives 100%.<br>"
118,217,"- Mom's Wig|force=na+: Holding down a fire button to charge the attack very rapidly rolls the probability to spawn Familiar#Blue Spiders|blue spiders; releasing to fire the beam, however, does not.<br>"
118,5,- My Reflection:<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|na}} Overridden by Brimstone.<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|anr}} Makes the beam curve when moving. It has the same effect on {{C|Azazel}}'s mini-brimstone but doubles the range.<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|r}} Makes the beam shoot from the back. An oval beam is shot from the front instead.<br>
118,606,"- Ocular Rift: Rifts may appear where the beam hits rocks, walls or enemies.<br>"
118,220,"- Sad Bombs: Upon exploding, bombs release ten beams in all directions.<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|r}} Brimstone does not benefit from Sad Bombs' flat damage bonus.<br>"
118,330,"- Soy Milk|force=r: Fires automatically upon reaching full charge. The beam lasts indefinitely as long as the fire key is held. The beam can change its direction while being fired, and can be aimed in any direction with joystick controls.<br>&emsp;- Increasing tears will also increase damage.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- Damage per Tick = Damage × Fire Rate / 5<br>&emsp;- Soy Milk|force=r + Chocolate Milk: The beam does 25% more damage. Does not increase Isaac's damage stat itself.<br>"
118,315,"- Strange Attractor: Enemies are attracted towards the beam, improving its consistency. Consumables will also be moved by the beam.<br>"
118,556,- Sulfur: Grants a larger beam with a 1.2x damage multiplier and +1 damage (same effect as picking up a second Brimstone).<br>
118,38,"- Tammy's Head: Shoots ten beams in all directions. Given the item's single room charge, this makes for an extremely powerful synergy.<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|r}} Brimstone does not benefit from Tammy's Head's flat damage bonus anymore.<br>"
118,395,"- Tech X: Tech X has priority. Does not apply Brimstone's tears down. Fires a Brimstone ring. This Brimstone ring is larger than the laser ring and has a much wider hitbox.<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|r}} Double Brimstone: Further increases the width of the ring, and grants +1 Damage.<br>&emsp;- Tech X + {{C|Azazel}}:<br>&emsp;&emsp;- {{Dlc|na+}} Overridden by Azazel's Brimstone.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- {{Dlc|a+nr}} Overrides Azazel's Brimstone. This works quite well with Azazel's good initial damage stat and also negates his initial range penalty.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- {{Dlc|r}} Applies 35% damage penalty and fires a Brimstone ring instead of Tech X ring. If combined with Brimstone, the damage penalty is negated.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- The same applies to {{C|Tainted Azazel}}.<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|nr}} Tech X + Mom's Knife: Mom's Knife and a Mom's Knife + Brimstone barrage are shot alongside the rings.<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|nr}} Tech X + Technology: The 1.5x damage multiplier from Brimstone + Technology is lost, but the laser fires while charging the Brimstone ring.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- {{Dlc|r}} Fires a Brimstone ring coiled by a laser. The 1.5x damage multiplier from Brimstone + Technology is retained.<br>"
118,233,"- Tiny Planet: The beam will wrap around Isaac once and then shoot straight forward.<br>&emsp;- If combined with My Reflection, the beam will first wrap around Isaac, form an oval beam in a longer range, then shoot backward. Interestingly enough, the beam will look like a G clef symbol.<br>"
