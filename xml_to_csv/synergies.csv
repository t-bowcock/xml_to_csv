I329,I528,"- Angelic Prism: While the tear is in contact with the prism, it will fire 4 additional tears in cardinal directions at Isaac's tear rate.<br>"
I329,I506,- Backstabber: Much easier to inflict bleeding and double damage on most enemies.<br>
I329,I704,- Berserk!: The tear can't be controlled while berserking but it can be batted around the room until the effect ends.<br>&emsp;- Tainted Samson: uses a passive form of Berserk! that works the same way.<br>
I329,I118,"- Brimstone: Tear takes the shape of a very large laser ring. {{Dlc|nr}} The shot speed is ignored. The Tears stat is ignored and the damage is dealt very rapidly at a rate equivalent to 1 tear delay.

I329,I453,"- Compound Fracture: Turns tear into a large bone, which shoots out smaller tears when attacking/touching an enemy. Scattered tears are spectral and piercing.<br>"
I329,I373,"- Dead Eye: Damage bonus increases until it hits the max of 2x. Since the controllable tear never hits the ground or wall, the bonus cannot be lost.<br>"
I329,I52,"- Dr. Fetus: A bomb is shot out at high speed and can be controlled, another bomb cannot be shot until the previously shot bomb has detonated.<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|r}} Causes your tears to act like Epic Fetus and now inherits all synergies Epic Fetus has.<br>"
I329,I572,"- Eye of the Occult: While holding a direction key, the Ludovico tear will constantly shoot out controllable tears in random directions. The air time of these tears scales with the range stat.<br>"

I329,I418,"- Fruit Cake: The tear will cycle through different effects, based on Isaac's tear rate.<br>&emsp;- (Added in Afterbirth+, Removed in Repentance) If Isaac stays in one room long enough the Ludovico tear will often fill the room with many stationary Trisagion tears that last until Isaac leaves the room. This combination can easily clear most rooms.<br>"
I329,C16,"- (Added in Afterbirth+) The Forgotten: The tear follows the Forgotten when in its skeleton form. It can be hit with its melee attack to propel it, making it do more damage. When switching to the Soul, the tear behaves as normal.<br>&emsp;- '''The Forgotten''' + Multidimensional Baby: The second tear acts exactly like the first and can also be hit to propel it.<br>&emsp;- '''The Forgotten''' + Multi-shot: Switching back from the Soul to the Forgotten will only remove the main tear, thus creating infinitely persisting tears on the screen. Repeating this process allows suspending arbitrarily high amount of tears.<br>"
I329,I331,"- Godhead: The tear homes towards nearby enemies and gains a large damaging aura. However, the aura cannot damage an enemy that is in contact with the actual tear; barring a high tear rate, it may be better to keep the aura on the enemies instead of the tear.<br>"
I329,I374,- holy light: The Ludovico tear will release holy beams on itself periodically while touching an enemy.<br>
I329,I360,"- Incubus|anr: Isaac gains a controlled tear while also being able to shoot normally with Incubus. Incubus's tears gain piercing and spectral properties.<br>&emsp;- (Added in Repentance) Incubus creates a second smaller Ludovico Technique tear instead, which can both be controlled by Isaac.

This may cause it to not hit enemies sometimes.<br>&emsp;- (Added in Repentance)  Lilith:  Lilith's incubus will fire a smaller Ludovico Technique tear. For each doubled incubus caused by Box of Friends, there will be an additional Ludovico Technique tear that spawns on Lilith's location.<br>"

I329,I104,- The Parasite: Shoots out smaller tears when attacking an enemy. Scattered tears are spectral and piercing.<br>
I329,I478,"- Pause: The tear deals damage, even if the enemies are stopped. Moving the tear unpauses the enemies.<br>"
I329,I315,"- Strange Attractor: Enemies, items and even most bosses will be sucked to the single floating tear, dealing constant damage while keeping Isaac well away from harm, making this combination extremely effective in almost all scenarios.<br>"
I329,I383,"- Tear Detonator: The tear explodes into six smaller tears, then reappears next to the player.<br>"
I329,I68,"- Technology: The tear becomes a large laser ring, which visually looks like a shot fired by Tech X|n. Shot speed is ignored. The Tears stat is ignored and the damage is dealt very rapidly at a rate equivalent to 1 tear delay.<br>"
I329,I395,"- Technology: The tear becomes a large laser ring, which visually looks like a shot fired by Tech X|n. Shot speed is ignored. The Tears stat is ignored and the damage is dealt very rapidly at a rate equivalent to 1 tear delay.<br>"
I329,I244,"- Tech.5: The tear controls as usual, and Isaac fires the laser towards the tear relative to his position, rather than in the direction the player is moving the tear.<br>"
I4,I706,- Abyss: When Isaac uses Abyss to absorb Cricket's Head it turns into a larger red locust dealing triple Isaacâ€™s damage per tick.<br>
I304,I704,"- Berserk!: For some reason, as you gain more kills while berserk, Libra steadily increases the damage, tears, and range stat with seemingly no limit, allowing massively high DPS, but targets are much more difficult to hit as the range of the swing gradually extending outwards more and more with each kill.<br>"
I304,I330,"- Soy Milk: As tear delay is valued very highly by the formula, greatly increases all stats.<br>&emsp;- (Added in Repentance) Soy Milk is only a minor DPS upgrade, and as such a very minor all stats up.<br>"
I304,I149,- Ipecac: Can be rapidly fired with decreased damage.<br>
I304,I562,"- Rock Bottom: Stats will increase as a result of items, get locked at the highest point, and then be balanced out via Libra allowing items like Ipecac and Soy Milk to have higher damage/shot speed respectively.<br>"
I304,I299,"- Taurus: Gradually increases all stats in an incomplete room. Libra prevents Isaac from becoming invincible (unless with high stats), and stat increases will remain until the end of the fight.<br>"
I304,T65,"- Tape Worm: As range is valued very highly by the formula, greatly increases all stats. Synergizes well with Mom's Box.<br>&emsp;- (Added in Repentance) Tape Worm is a flat +3 range instead of x2, resulting in only a small all stats up.<br>"

I245,C14,"- (Added in Afterbirth, Removed in Repentance)Keeper: Fires 5 tears with no fire rate decrease.<br>&emsp;- (Added in Repentance) Decreases tears' spread. Reduces damage dealt to 75%, but makes his base tear stat equal 2.73. This is a damage per second increase if tear rate before picking up was less than 3.75; otherwise this is a damage per second decrease. This is the same for Tainted Keeper.<br>"
I245,I329,"- The Ludovico Technique: The Ludovico tear gains one smaller tear orbiting the main one, each dealing the same amount of damage.<br>"

I63,I382,"- Friendly Ball|force=r: Walking over a captured enemy will double charge the ball, allowing the enemy to be released, and allowing to catch a new one in the same room, and the process repeats. This allows the Friendly Ball to be used much, ''much'' more often, and gathering many more friends. Note: trying to catch a new enemy while the old one is in the process of spawning will result in the ball phasing through, catching nothing, thus wasting charge.<br>"
I63,I147,- {{Dlc|r}} Notched Axe: Causes remaining charge from the previous floor to carry over to the next one.<br>

I254,I229,- Monstro's Lung: Effect is applied every time you shoot.<br>
I254,I595,"- Saturnus: Orbiting tears will be the same as the last fired tear before leaving the previous room. To guarantee orbiting tears with the Blood Clot damage bonus, your last fired tear before leaving a room must come from the left eye.<br>"
I254,I152,"- Technology 2: As the laser from Technology 2 occupies your right eye, all tears now fired from the left eye have the statistical benefit of Blood Clot applied.<br>"
I254,I358,"- The Wiz: Blood Clot applies on both eyes, meaning the second shot from either eye will always be a Blood Clot shot. It will randomly alternate which shot of the two eyes counts for the other's Blood Clot shot if you fire multiple tears per shot like with Cursed Eye.<br>"

I118,I222,"- Anti-Gravity: An orb of energy expands, then shrinks while firing the beam after a delay. The orb still hurts enemies if they touch it. Isaac can start charging a new shot immediately after releasing the fire key without canceling the first shot, effectively allowing for a faster firing rate. It makes it harder to hit enemies with Azazel as the beam does not increase in range. {{Dlc|r}} Size and damage of the beams no longer scale with fire rate as well as lasting infinitely at above 15 fire rate.<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|r}} Anti-Gravity + Soy Milk / Almond Milk: Allows auto firing upon full charge but without permanent beam uptime.<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|anr}} Anti-Gravity + Incubus: Isaac will fire Brimstone orbs, while Incubus will fire regular Brimstone beams.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- {{Dlc|r}} Both Isaac and Incubus fire Brimstone orbs.<br>"

The width of the beams doubles.<br>&emsp;- Haemolacria + Chocolate Milk: The Brimstone beams deal full damage regardless of charge.<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|r}} Haemolacria + Technology: The lasers coil the beams. This is purely visual and does not grant a 1.5x damage multiplier.<br>
I118,I726,- Hemoptysis: Enemies hit by the sneeze will gain a curse that increases the damage Brimstone deals to 2x and +3 flat damage. Enemies who die to Brimstone under the curse will damage and spread the curse to nearby enemies.<br>
