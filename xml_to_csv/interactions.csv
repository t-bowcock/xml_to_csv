I329,I320,"- ???'s Only Friend / Robo-Baby 2.0: The tear and familiar(s) travel together, as they are controlled in the same way. Because the familiars' travel speeds are not affected by Isaac's shot speed, they only travel in the same spot when Isaac has exactly the amount of shot speed to sync them up.<br>"
I329,I267,"- ???'s Only Friend / Robo-Baby 2.0: The tear and familiar(s) travel together, as they are controlled in the same way. Because the familiars' travel speeds are not affected by Isaac's shot speed, they only travel in the same spot when Isaac has exactly the amount of shot speed to sync them up.<br>"
I329,I561,"- Almond Milk The tear will rapidly teleport in a small area around it, making it difficult to aim.<br>"
I329,I616,- Bird's Eye: Isaac will occasionally shoot a flame towards the Ludovico tear.<br>
I329,I254,"- Blood Clot / Chemical Peel: The tear steadily cycles between red and ""normal,"" dealing more damage when red.<br>"
I329,I154,"- Blood Clot / Chemical Peel: The tear steadily cycles between red and ""normal,"" dealing more damage when red.<br>"
I329,I69,"- Chocolate Milk|nr: The tear can't be charged, but reduces Isaac's Attributes#Tear Delay|tear delay by 20%.<br>"
I329,I103,"- The Common Cold: The tear pulses green, poisoning enemies.<br>"
I329,I401,"- Explosivo|na+: Tear will alternate between ""normal"" and black. If it touches an enemy, it will stick to it, grow in size, then explode. The tear can not damage anything or be controlled when stuck to an enemy.<br>&emsp;- (Added in Afterbirth+, Removed in Repentance) The tear will grow very quickly when stuck to an enemy and pop without dealing damage, instead of the normal Explosivo delay and explosion.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- (Added in Repentance) The Ludovico Tear will not get stuck on an enemy, instead a duplicate Tear gets stuck on the enemy, grows and explodes.<br>"
I329,I257,- Fire Mind|na+: Tears retain the ability to ignite enemies and explode. Tears reappear at Isaac's location after exploding.<br>&emsp;- (Added in Afterbirth+) Tears do not explode on contact with an enemy.<br>
I329,I495,- Ghost Pepper|nr / Red Candle|nr: Fires created from Ghost Pepper will destroy the tear and cause it to reappear at Isaac's location.<br>&emsp;- (Added in Repentance) Fires generated by both items do not interact with the Ludovico tear. However Ghost Pepper will create fires quickly when the Tear is moved.<br>
I329,I289,- Ghost Pepper|nr / Red Candle|nr: Fires created from Ghost Pepper will destroy the tear and cause it to reappear at Isaac's location.<br>&emsp;- (Added in Repentance) Fires generated by both items do not interact with the Ludovico tear. However Ghost Pepper will create fires quickly when the Tear is moved.<br>
I329,I114,- Mom's Knife: The tear becomes a controllable knife that deals double Isaac's damage. Effective shot speed is lowered. Tears stat is ignored and the damage is dealt at a rate equivalent to 4 tear delay.<br>&emsp;- '''Mom's Knife''' + Flat Stone / Monstro's Lung / Brimstone / Technology: The latter items are overridden completely.<br>
I329,I431,"- Multidimensional Baby|na+: No effect.<br>&emsp;- (Added in Afterbirth+, Removed in Repentance) An additional Ludovico tear is created when it passes through Multidimensional Baby, at the start of every room, and persists like the Ludovico tear itself. However, it cannot be controlled; it instead slowly follows Isaac.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- (Added in Repentance) The extra tear stays completely still where it appeared.<br>"
I329,I147,"- Notched Axe|nr: The Ludovico tear cannot be moved while Notched Axe is held up.<br>&emsp;- (Added in Repentance) The tear can be moved by swings, without any special effect happening to it.<br>"
I329,I261,"- Proptosis: The closer the tear floats to Isaac, the larger it is. The farther away, the smaller.<br>"
I329,I379,"- Pupula Duplex: Decreases the tear size by taking the form of a Pupula Duplex tear; however, it travels faster.<br>"
I329,I459,"- Sinus Infection|nr / Nose Goblin|nr: The tear can occasionally stick to an enemy. If the enemy does not die quickly, the tear pops and a new one appears.<br>&emsp;- (Added in Repentance) Like Explosivo, no longer sticks the original Tear to the enemy, instead places a replacement booger, which deals the same damage.<br>"
I329,T98,"- Sinus Infection|nr / Nose Goblin|nr: The tear can occasionally stick to an enemy. If the enemy does not die quickly, the tear pops and a new one appears.<br>&emsp;- (Added in Repentance) Like Explosivo, no longer sticks the original Tear to the enemy, instead places a replacement booger, which deals the same damage.<br>"
I329,I463,- Sulfuric Acid: The Ludovico tear occasionally becomes acidic and can destroy objects.<br>
I329,C32,- Tainted Lilith|r: Gello|n shoots a smaller Ludovico tear which disappears if he retreats back into Lilith.<br>
I329,I728,- Tainted Lilith|r: Gello|n shoots a smaller Ludovico tear which disappears if he retreats back into Lilith.<br>
I329,I152,"- Technology 2|nr: The tear controls as usual, and Isaac fires the laser towards the tear relative to his position, rather than in the direction the player is moving the tear. Technology 2's damage penalty still applies. The laser becomes spectral.<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|r}}Technology 2's tears penalty applies instead of damage.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- '''Technology 2''' + Analog Stick: Laser is fired directly at the tear while it is being moved, instead of being limited to cardinal directions.<br>"
I329,I524,- Technology Zero: No effect without additional items. Extra tears orbiting the main one or familiar tears will generate arcs to the controlled tear.<br>
I329,I358,"- The Wiz: A smaller Ludovico tear will appear and revolve around the main one. Also, the Ludovico tear moves diagonally, up is up-right, down is down-left, left is left-up, right is right-down. This can be counteracted by holding the keys or d-pad in its associated path (up-right to make it go up and so forth with the other keys).<br>"
I329,I233,"- Tiny Planet: Tear orbits around Isaac, however, the orbit can be grown or shrunken, sped up or slowed down by using the firing keys.<br>"
I329,I150,"- Tough Love / Jawbreaker: Tear occasionally flicks to being a tooth, which deals 3.2x Isaac's tear damage, before immediately returning to being a normal tear. The frequency at which the tear very briefly transforms into a tooth increases with Luck, permanently becoming a tooth at 9 Luck. Jawbreaker does not change the tear appearance.<br>"
I329,T129,"- Tough Love / Jawbreaker: Tear occasionally flicks to being a tooth, which deals 3.2x Isaac's tear damage, before immediately returning to being a normal tear. The frequency at which the tear very briefly transforms into a tooth increases with Luck, permanently becoming a tooth at 9 Luck. Jawbreaker does not change the tear appearance.<br>"
I329,T129,"- Tough Love / Jawbreaker: Tear occasionally flicks to being a tooth, which deals 3.2x Isaac's tear damage, before immediately returning to being a normal tear. The frequency at which the tear very briefly transforms into a tooth increases with Luck, permanently becoming a tooth at 9 Luck. Jawbreaker does not change the tear appearance.<br>"
I329,I243,"- Trinity Shield: The controls of the tear and the shield overlap, making it impossible to consistently control both.<br>"
I329,I659,"- Tropicamide: No size increase effect. Ludovico tear size scales with damage, and not with size multipliers.<br>"
I304,I561,"- Almond Milk: Almond Milk is only a minor DPS upgrade, and as such a very minor all stats up.<br>"
I304,I224,"- Cricket's Body|nr: Due to how Libra values tear delay, Cricket's Body gives an overall stat downgrade or upgrade depending on Isaac's internal base tear delay: At 7 or less it increases stats, at 8 or more it decreases stats.<br>"
I304,I406,"- D8: D8's stat changes depend on which stats end up with which multipliers and their base values. Range has a high weight and is uncapped, and thus can result in a massive boost if it scores a high multiplier. Damage is also uncapped but, on the other hand, has a low weight.<br>&emsp;- (Added in Repentance) The changes in Libra's formula mean D8 is very likely to give a small all stats up, its magnitude depending on Isaac's other items and which stats were emphasized.<br>"
I304,I705,"- Dark Arts: Libra is extremely detrimental to how Dark Arts works, and should not be used together: The speed boost during the invincibility phase is transferred into attack bonuses (Which are useless as tears cannot be used), and afterwards, the temporary damage boost is divided across all of Isaac's stats, resulting in very negligible stat boosts.<br>"
I304,I368,- Epiphora: The stat bonus for continuously firing in one direction applies to all stats. The accuracy penalty is unaffected.<br>
I304,I310,"- Eve's Mascara: Gives an overall stat downgrade, due to tears being weighted heavier than damage.<br>&emsp;- (Added in Repentance) Eve's Mascara is a DPS up with no other relevant stats, and as such is a small all stats up.<br>"
I304,I240,"- Experimental Treatment: The greater number of stat upgrades compared to stat downgrades results in an effectively guaranteed all stats up. Health, Shot Speed, and Luck are still subject to chance.<br>"
I304,I407,"- Purity: At base stats, the tear delay and damage aura give a greater stat bonus than the range or speed aura.<br>&emsp;- (Added in Repentance) All the auras grant a small all stats up of similar magnitudes.<br>"
I304,I417,"- Succubus: When in the aura, affects re-balanced stats rather than just damage.<br>"
I304,I152,- Technology 2|nr: Doubled tear delay due to firing out of only one eye is unaffected by the balancing formula.<br>
I304,I233,"- Tiny Planet: The significant range increase results in a large stat boost to speed and tears and a small boost to damage. However, the decrease in range causes orbiting tears to no longer complete a full 360° lap around Isaac, instead dropping off at about half that.<br>"
I245,I118,- (Removed in Afterbirth)Brimstone: Overrides 20/20.<br>
I245,I2,- (Removed in Afterbirth)The Inner Eye: Overrides 20/20.<br>
I245,I440,"- Kidney Stone: Increase number of tears in tear barrage; however, only fires one stone.<br>"
I245,I87,- Loki's Horns: Only occasionally fires one tear in the other three directions.<br>
I245,I55,- Mom's Eye: Only occasionally fires one tear out of the back of Isaac's head.<br>

I245,I68,- (Removed in Afterbirth)Technology: Overrides 20/20.<br>
I245,I452,- Varicose Veins: No effect on number of tears when taking damage.<br>
I116,I116,- 9 Volt: No further decrease in charges.<br>
I116,I585,- Alabaster Box: No effect.<br>
I116,T101,"- Dim Bulb: Prevents Dim Bulb from working, as minimum charge becomes 1 instead of 0.<br>"
I116,I638,- Eraser: No effect.<br>
I116,I720,"- Everything Jar / Larynx: The first bar gains an automatic recharge, but the further bars will not be affected.<br>"
I116,I611,"- Everything Jar / Larynx: The first bar gains an automatic recharge, but the further bars will not be affected.<br>"
I116,I205,"- (Removed in Repentance)Sharp Plug: Renders the Sharp Plug unusable on 2+ charge items. Sharp Plug can only be used if the item is at 0 charges, but 9 Volt instantly gives +1 charge to the item upon activation.<br>&emsp;- (Added in Repentance) Lowers the cost of using Sharp Plug by half a heart on 2+ charge items.<br>"
I231,T78,- Second Hand|a+nr: The creep generated by Ball of Tar will disable the slowing effect.<br>
I180,T78,- Second Hand: The poison duration is not increased.<br>
I254,I360,- Incubus: Incubus is not affected by Blood Clot.<br>
I157,I347,"- Diplopia: No effect, damage up still caps at +6 and increases at the same intervals<br>"
I157,I695,"- bloody gust: Bloody Lust's ""rage"" effect is shared with Bloody Gust, so if Isaac picks up Bloody Gust after already getting hit with Bloody Lust (or vice versa) the boosts will automatically update to that level.<br>"
I7,I7,- Blood of the Martyr: No further effect when multiple copies of the item are acquired.<br>
I125,I47,- Doctor's Remote/Epic Fetus: Crosshair will not home in on enemies.<br>
I125,I168,- Doctor's Remote/Epic Fetus: Crosshair will not home in on enemies.<br>
I118,I245,- {{Dlc|na}}20/20: Overridden by Brimstone.<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|a}} Adds a second Brimstone.<br>
I118,I359,"- 8 Inch Nails: Beams gain knockback, pushing enemies away in the direction they travel but not out of their path. This increases its consistency.<br>"
I118,I706,- Abyss: When Isaac uses Abyss to absorb Brimstone it turns into a larger gray locust but otherwise acts like normal locusts created by Abyss.<br>
I118,I616,- Bird's Eye: Will occasionally spawn a fire when firing and with high luck will spawn four fires.<br>
I118,I69,- Chocolate Milk|force=nr: Reduces Isaac's tear delay by 20%. Does not increase damage.<br>
I118,I453,- Compound Fracture: Splitting is overridden. The stat change is applied as normal.<br>

I118,I52,- Dr. Fetus|r: Overrides Brimstone.<br>
I118,I168,"- Epic Fetus:<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|na}} Overrides Brimstone.<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|a}} Adds a Brimstone Sad Bombs effect: missile explosions shoot ten beams in all directions, massively increasing damage and area of effect.<br>"
I118,I368,"- Epiphora: Effect only activates when holding charge in a specific direction, and deactivates when the charge is released, effectively making Epiphora useless unless Isaac has exceedingly high tear delay.<br>"
I118,I410,- Evil Eye: Overridden by Brimstone.<br>
I118,I462,- Eye of Belial: Overridden by Brimstone.<br>
I118,I401,- Explosivo:<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|nr}} Overridden by Brimstone.<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|r}} The beam has 20% chance to stick explosive tears to enemies on every other tick.<br>
I118,I257,"- Fire Mind: The beam will not cause explosions, but will still set enemies on Status_Effects#Burn|fire.<br>"
I118,I540,- Flat Stone: Overridden by Brimstone.<br>
I118,C16,- The Forgotten: The charged attack will spawn a Brimstone ball that will float in front of The Forgotten for a few seconds before disappearing. The Forgotten will still melee attack while performing this action.<br>
I118,I495,- Ghost Pepper:<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|nr}} The flames can still shoot from Isaac while holding the fire button.<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|r}} Has a chance to shoot flames for every other tick while the beam is being fired.<br>

I118,I149,"- Ipecac:<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|na+}} Does not apply Ipecac's stat changes. The beam poisons enemies.<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|a+nr}} Isaac shoots Ipecac tears while charging Brimstone. Stat changes from both items are applied as normal, meaning that Ipecac fires slower and Brimstone charges slower, but Brimstone deals drastically increased damage.<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|r}} Applies +2 flat damage, instead of Ipecac's damage up. Does not apply Ipecac's tears down. The beam explodes on the first enemy or obstacle it hits every other tick, dealing 10 + twice of Isaac's Damage. The beam gains a poison effect. The explosions do not occur when the beam narrows, meaning that they occur only twice per shot without Soy Milk / Almond Milk. The beam and its explosions poison enemies. The Ladder, when placed, will trigger the Ipecac-Brimstone explosions. (possibly a bug)<br>&emsp;&emsp;- Haemolacria EXTREMELY DANGEROUS! Tears will explode into multiple brimstone beams, each of which has a chance to hit Isaac and explode<br>"

I118,I532,"- Lachryphagy:<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|nr}} Overridden by Brimstone.<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|r}} Brimstone has shorter range, a bit longer than Azazel's brimstone, and it is not affected from Range. The beam fires Pop! tears at the end, which is Piercing.<br>"
I118,I502,- Large Zit: Creep shots will still be fired occasionally while holding the fire button.<br>
I118,I444,- Lead Pencil:<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|nr}} Overridden by Brimstone.<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|r}} Lead Pencil triggers approximately every 2 seconds as the beam is fired (charge time is not counted).<br>
I118,I617,"- Lodestone: Changes the beam to gray, can still apply the magnetized effect. The beams are not attracted to enemies with the magnetized effect.<br>"
I118,I394,- Marked:<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|nr}} Overridden by Brimstone.<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|r}} Fires automatically upon reaching full charge. Fires at the direction of the crosshair.<br>
I118,I229,"- Monstro's Lung:<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|na}} Overridden by Brimstone.<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|a}} Brimstone has priority. Does not apply Monstro's Lung's tears down. Fires 3-5 additional beams in random directions around Isaac. This effect also applies to Azazel and Tainted Azazel's Brimstone.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- {{Dlc|nr}} Charging a new Brimstone beam removes the original from in front of Isaac, but not the additional ones added by Monstro's Lung.<br>"
I118,I553,- Mucormycosis: The beam has 25% chance to spawn spore to enemies on every other tick.<br>
I118,I317,"- Mysterious Liquid:<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|na}} Overridden by Brimstone.<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|a}} Leaves a creep for each enemy and obstacle the beam hits, on every other tick. Azazel's Brimstone leaves creeps at the end of its range.<br>"
I118,I597,- Neptunus: Overridden by Brimstone.<br>
I118,I6,"- Number One: Although Number One is otherwise purely beneficial with standard Brimstone, Azazel's range is severely affected.<br>"
I118,C7,"- Number One: Although Number One is otherwise purely beneficial with standard Brimstone, Azazel's range is severely affected.<br>"
I118,I104,- The Parasite:<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|nr}} Splitting is overridden. The stat changes are applied as normal.<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|r}} Spawns two perpendicular beams on the first enemy or obstacle the beam hits.<br>

I118,I68,"- Technology:<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|na}} Overridden by Brimstone, but adds damage.<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|a}} The Technology laser coils around the Brimstone beam, granting a 1.5x damage multiplier (it stacks with other similar multipliers like Cricket's Head or Magic Mushroom).<br>&emsp;&emsp;- {{Dlc|r}} Technology's damage multiplier will be overridden if Isaac has the powered up version (from picking up Brimstone twice or using Sulfur with Brimstone).<br>"
I118,I524,- Technology Zero: Overridden by Brimstone.<br>
I118,I152,"- Technology 2:<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|na}} Overridden by Brimstone, but retains the reduced damage.<br>&emsp;- {{Dlc|a}} Both fire normally; the Technology laser fires while charging Brimstone.<br>"

I103,T30,"- Pinky Eye: Activation rates are individually applied to each tear, effectively allowing for higher amounts of poison tears. However at 12 Luck, the trinket will not do anything for Isaac as The Common Cold is guaranteed to make every tear poisoned at that point.<br>"
I69,I222,"- Anti-Gravity: No effect, but retains the reduced tear delay.<br>"
I69,I118,"- (Removed in Repentance) Brimstone: Doesn't increase damage, but reduces Isaac's current Tears#Tear Delay|tear delay by 20% (allows Brimstone to charge faster). Beam is colored brown. It also applies to Azazel's default mini-brimstone.<br>&emsp;- (Added in Repentance) Brimstone laser takes longer to fully charge, but can be released at any point during its charge. Width and damage of the laser increases at higher charges. Width scales from 50% at minimum charge to 160% at maximum charge. Damage scales from 25% at minimum charge to 250% at maximum charge. Unlike with normal tears, the tears stat does not directly affect maximum or minimum damage.<br>"

I69,I678,- C Section|r: Overrides Chocolate Milk.<br>
I69,I316,"- (Removed in Repentance) Cursed Eye: The charge bar only indicates the current charge for Chocolate Milk, not for Cursed Eye; the latter's charge is determined by the eye's glow. If charged until Cursed Eye fully glows, Isaac fires one Chocolate Milk shot, followed by up to three minimal power ones.<br>&emsp;- (Added in Repentance) Cursed Eye takes longer to charge, but low damage shots can be fired rapidly. If fully charged, Isaac fires five Chocolate Milk shots.<br>"
I69,I52,"- (Removed in Repentance) Dr. Fetus: Bombs can't be charged, but reduces Isaac's current tear delay by 20% (allows Dr. Fetus to fire faster). Bombs are brown.<br>"
I69,I168,"- (Removed in Repentance) Epic Fetus: Missiles can't be charged, but reduces Isaac's current tear delay by 20% (allows Epic Fetus' missiles to be fired with a shorter delay between them). Changes the explosion color to brown.<br>"

I69,I441,"- Mega Blast: Firing the Mega Blast beam while Chocolate Milk charges preserve the charge, but does not increase the beam's damage.<br>"
I69,I597,- Neptunus: Overrides Chocolate Milk's active charge. Tear damage is determined by how charged Neptunus is.<br>
