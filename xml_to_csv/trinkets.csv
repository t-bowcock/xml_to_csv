Since Curved Horn is applied after every calculation, it will '''always''' be +2 damage.<br>&emsp;- Picking up Curved Horn while having damage multipliers, like Magic Mushroom or Cricket's Head, makes Curved Horn even more beneficial from the multiplier (bringing, in the case of a x1.5 multiplier, the damage it grants to +3).<br>&emsp;- Curved Horn's damage does not ignore damage reduction multipliers, such as Odd Mushroom (Thin) (damage<br>&emsp;- 0.9 - 0.38 damage down), Technology 2|nr (-35% damage down), and Soy Milk (-80% damage down).<br>"

Entering a room that previously contained other types of Chests while holding The Left Hand will turn them into Red Chests permanently.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- (Added in Repentance) Chests that have already spawned are not converted into Red Chests.<br>&emsp;- It is advised to drop The Left Hand (by holding either ''CTRL'' key for few seconds, holding R2 or RT for 3 seconds on PS4 and Vita and Xbox One, respectively, or holding ZR on the New Nintendo 3DS / Nintendo Switch for a few seconds) before entering Chest, as non-Red Chests always contain item pedestals on this floor, especially the 4 located in the starting room.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- (Removed in Repentance) Isaac may prefer Red Chests for their possible Soul Hearts or Red Chest items, at the expense of guaranteed items.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- (Added in Repentance) Locked Chests converted in Chest's starting room will contain Devil Deals, potentially allowing for more powerful items, but at the cost of Hearts.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Red Chests found past the starting rooms of either Chest or Dark Room will contain regular Red Chest drops.
