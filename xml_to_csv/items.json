This tear deals constant damage when held in place over an enemy.\n\n== Notes ==\n* {{dlc|nr}} The Ludovico Technique is a [[special item]].\n* Ludovico tear is piercing and spectral by default.\n* Ludovico tear movement speed is determined by the [[shot speed]] stat.\n* Ludovico tear hits per second are determined by the [[tears]] stat, maxed out at 30 ticks per second.\n* When {{E|Death}} uses his {{I|The Hourglass}} attack, the tear is slow to respond but then moves so quickly that it is nearly impossible to use effectively.\n*{{dlc|nr}} When there are no enemies in a room, the tear slowly floats towards the player.\n** The {{I|Brimstone}} ring still follows when the player is outside of it.\n* If multiple Ludovico Techniques are acquired (via {{i|Diplopia}}, {{i|Crooked Penny}} or on a [[victory lap]]), then additional smaller tears will orbit the main tear.\n** A maximum of 15 smaller tears can orbit the main tear.\n* The Ludovico tear is larger than normal, but does not gain size from damage as much as normal tears.\n\n== Synergies ==\n* {{i|20/20}} / {{i|The Inner Eye}} / {{I|Mutant Spider}}: Smaller tears orbits the main tear.\n*{{C|Azazel}}: The same effect as with Brimstone, but the damage is halved.\n**'''Azazel''' + {{i|Brimstone}}: Full damage of the laser ring is regained.\n* {{Dlc|r}}{{C|Tainted Azazel}}: The same effect as Brimstone, dealing full damage (Tainted Azazel's default laser damage is halved unless {{I|Hemoptysis}} is used first). Tainted Azazel can no longer use Hemoptysis.\n*{{I|Angelic Prism}}: While the tear is in contact with the prism, it will fire 4 additional tears in cardinal directions at Isaac's tear rate.\n*{{I|Backstabber}}: Much easier to inflict bleeding and double damage on most enemies.\n*{{I|Berserk!}}: The tear can't be controlled while berserking but it can be batted around the room until the effect ends.\n**{{C|Tainted Samson}}: uses a passive form of Berserk! that works the same way.\n*{{transf|Bookworm}}: Causes an additional smaller tear to constantly appear and disappear, teleporting from Isaac's location to the main Ludovico tear in a glitchy manner.\n*{{i|Brimstone}}: Tear takes the shape of a very large laser ring. {{Dlc|nr}} The shot speed is ignored. The Tears stat is ignored and the damage is dealt very rapidly at a rate equivalent to 1 tear delay. This ring will always be present and doesn't need charging up like normal Brimstone would.\n**'''Brimstone''' + {{i|Incubus}}: Incubus' Brimstone laser is not affected by Ludovico Technique.\n***{{Dlc|r}} Adds a smaller controllable laser ring in addition to the main one.\n**{{Dlc|r}} '''Brimstone''' + {{i|Ipecac}}: +2 damage, beam explodes when colliding with enemies and obstacles.\n**'''Brimstone''' + {{i|A Lump of Coal}}: The ring increases in diameter, but not the damage, the farther away it gets from Isaac.\n**'''Brimstone''' + {{i|Spoon Bender}}: The ring reaches out to attack enemies near it, reforming into a ring when no enemies are present.\n**'''Brimstone''' + {{i|Technology}}: The ring is visually identical to a normal Brimstone ring, but the 1.5x damage multiplier applies.\n**'''Brimstone''' + {{i|20/20}}/{{i|The Inner Eye}}/{{I|Mutant Spider}}: no effect.\n*{{i|Compound Fracture}}: Turns tear into a large bone, which shoots out smaller tears when attacking/touching an enemy. Scattered tears are spectral and piercing.\n*{{i|Dead Eye}}: Damage bonus increases until it hits the max of 2x. Since the controllable tear never hits the ground or wall, the bonus cannot be lost.\n*{{i|Dr. Fetus}}: A bomb is shot out at high speed and can be controlled, another bomb cannot be shot until the previously shot bomb has detonated.\n**{{Dlc|r}} Causes your tears to act like {{i|Epic Fetus}} and now inherits all synergies Epic Fetus has.\n*{{I|Eye of the Occult}}: While holding a direction key, the Ludovico tear will constantly shoot out controllable tears in random directions. The air time of these tears scales with the range stat.\n*{{i|Fate's Reward}}: The familiar gains spectral and piercing tears.\n*{{i|Flat Stone}}: The tear starts bouncing at a rate somewhat below Isaac's fire rate, each bounce dealing splash damage.\n**'''Flat Stone''' + {{i|Ipecac}}: Causes a poisonous explosion when it bounces instead of plain splash damage, as per normal Ipecac. The first bounce when entering a room does not explode, allowing moving the tear with less risk of self-damage.\n* {{i|Fruit Cake}}: The tear will cycle through different effects, based on Isaac's tear rate.\n** {{dlc|a+nr}} If Isaac stays in one room long enough the Ludovico tear will often fill the room with many stationary {{i|Trisagion}} tears that last until Isaac leaves the room. This combination can easily clear most rooms.\n*{{dlc|a+}} {{C|The Forgotten}}: The tear follows the Forgotten when in its skeleton form. It can be hit with its melee attack to propel it, making it do more damage. When switching to the Soul, the tear behaves as normal.\n**'''The Forgotten''' + {{i|Multidimensional Baby}}: The second tear acts exactly like the first and can also be hit to propel it.\n**'''The Forgotten''' + Multi-shot: Switching back from the Soul to the Forgotten will only remove the main tear, thus creating infinitely persisting tears on the screen. Repeating this process allows suspending arbitrarily high amount of tears.\n*{{i|Godhead}}: The tear homes towards nearby enemies and gains a large damaging aura. However, the aura cannot damage an enemy that is in contact with the actual tear; barring a high tear rate, it may be better to keep the aura on the enemies instead of the tear.\n*{{dlc|na+}} {{transf|Guppy}}: A large number of flies is rapidly deployed whilst controlling the Ludovico tear.\n*{{I|holy light}}: The Ludovico tear will release holy beams on itself periodically while touching an enemy. \n*{{i|Incubus|anr}}: Isaac gains a controlled tear while also being able to shoot normally with Incubus. Incubus's tears gain piercing and spectral properties.\n**{{dlc|r}} Incubus creates a second smaller Ludovico Technique tear instead, which can both be controlled by Isaac. The second tear is slightly delayed/ outside of the main tear. This may cause it to not hit enemies sometimes.\n**{{dlc|r}}  {{C|Lilith}}:  Lilith's incubus will fire a smaller Ludovico Technique tear. For each doubled incubus caused by {{i|Box of Friends}}, there will be an additional Ludovico Technique tear that spawns on Lilith's location.\n* {{i|Lead Pencil|a+nr}}: The tear blinks red, but the effect is entirely cosmetic.\n** {{dlc|r}} Tear barrages are launched in cardinal directions, even when not controlling the tear. Proc rate depends on fire rate.\n* {{I|Lodestone}}: The single floating tear will flash grey to indicate that the magnetism might apply on hit. Like Strange Attractor, enemies tagged with magnetism will also draw the floating tear towards said enemy.\n*{{i|Loki's Horns}}: The Ludovico tear will sometimes shoot 4 smaller tears in each cardinal direction.\n*{{i|Lost Contact}}: Tear will block enemy tears without disappearing.\n*{{i|A Lump of Coal}}: The tear becomes larger the further away it is from Isaac, increasing in damage.\n*{{i|Mom's Eye}}: The Ludovico tear has a chance on each damage tick to fire a smaller tear in a random direction. This chance scales with [[luck]] and goes up to 100% at 10 Luck.\n*{{dlc|na+}} {{i|Mom's Wig}}: The item causes spiders to spawn rapidly when moving the tear.\n**{{dlc|r}} Causes Spiders to rapidly spawn until the cap of 5 is reached.\n*{{i|Monstro's Lung}}: Tear turns red and does more damage. \n**{{dlc|a}} Tear becomes a cluster of variously sized tears spread over a small area. The tears move at the same speed when controlled but constantly move around each other.\n*{{I|Mysterious Liquid}}: Creep continuously oozes from underneath the tear.\n*{{I|My Reflection}}: The shot speed multiplier causes the tear to move significantly faster, allowing it to catch up to any fast-moving enemies.\n*{{i|The Parasite}}: Shoots out smaller tears when attacking an enemy. Scattered tears are spectral and piercing.\n*{{i|Pause}}: The tear deals damage, even if the enemies are stopped. Moving the tear unpauses the enemies.\n*{{i|Strange Attractor}}: Enemies, items and even most bosses will be sucked to the single floating tear, dealing constant damage while keeping Isaac well away from harm, making this combination extremely effective in almost all scenarios.\n*{{i|Tear Detonator}}: The tear explodes into six smaller tears, then reappears next to the player.\n*{{i|Technology}}: The tear becomes a large laser ring, which visually looks like a shot fired by {{i|Tech X|n}}. Shot speed is ignored. The Tears stat is ignored and the damage is dealt very rapidly at a rate equivalent to 1 tear delay.\n*{{i|Tech.5}}: The tear controls as usual, and Isaac fires the laser towards the tear relative to his position, rather than in the direction the player is moving the tear.\n\n== Interactions ==\n* Overrides The Ludovico Technique:\n** {{i|C Section}}\n*** Except when combined with {{i|Brimstone}} in which case fetuses cease to spawn.\n** {{i|Epic Fetus}}\n** {{i|Haemolacria}}, provides piercing tears\n** {{i|Tech X}}\n* Overridden by The Ludovico Technique:\n** {{i|Cursed Eye}}\n** {{i|Ipecac|na+}}\n*** {{dlc|a+nr}} +2 Damage.\n**** {{dlc|r}} +4 Damage.\n* Overridden by The Ludovico Technique, other than stat changes:\n** {{i|Anti-Gravity}}\n** {{i|Cricket's Body}}\n** {{i|Tractor Beam}}\n* {{i|???'s Only Friend}} / {{i|Robo-Baby 2.0}}: The tear and familiar(s) travel together, as they are controlled in the same way. Because the familiars' travel speeds are not affected by Isaac's shot speed, they only travel in the same spot when Isaac has exactly the amount of shot speed to sync them up.\n* {{I|Almond Milk}} The tear will rapidly teleport in a small area around it, making it difficult to aim.\n* {{i|Bird's Eye}}: Isaac will occasionally shoot a flame towards the Ludovico tear.\n* {{i|Blood Clot}} / {{i|Chemical Peel}}: The tear steadily cycles between red and \"normal,\" dealing more damage when red.\n* {{i|Chocolate Milk|nr}}: The tear can't be charged, but reduces Isaac's [[Attributes#Tear Delay|tear delay]] by 20%.\n* {{i|The Common Cold}}: The tear pulses green, poisoning enemies.\n* {{i|Explosivo|na+}}: Tear will alternate between \"normal\" and black. If it touches an enemy, it will stick to it, grow in size, then explode. The tear can not damage anything or be controlled when stuck to an enemy.\n** {{dlc|a+nr}} The tear will grow very quickly when stuck to an enemy and pop without dealing damage, instead of the normal Explosivo delay and explosion.\n*** {{dlc|r}} The Ludovico Tear will not get stuck on an enemy, instead a duplicate Tear gets stuck on the enemy, grows and explodes.\n* {{i|Fire Mind|na+}}: Tears retain the ability to ignite enemies and explode. Tears reappear at Isaac's location after exploding.\n** {{dlc|a+}} Tears do not explode on contact with an enemy.\n* {{i|Ghost Pepper|nr}} / {{i|Red Candle|nr}}: Fires created from Ghost Pepper will destroy the tear and cause it to reappear at Isaac's location.\n** {{dlc|r}} Fires generated by both items do not interact with the Ludovico tear. However Ghost Pepper will create fires quickly when the Tear is moved.\n* [[Tear Effects|Homing Tears]]: The Ludovico tear will slowly move towards an enemy. This can make it harder to control towards a different enemy or for enemies that hide underground.\n* {{i|Mom's Knife}}: The tear becomes a controllable knife that deals double Isaac's damage. Effective shot speed is lowered. Tears stat is ignored and the damage is dealt at a rate equivalent to 4 tear delay.\n** '''Mom's Knife''' + {{i|Flat Stone}} / {{i|Monstro's Lung}} / {{i|Brimstone}} / {{i|Technology}}: The latter items are overridden completely.\n* {{i|Multidimensional Baby|na+}}: No effect.\n** {{dlc|a+nr}} An additional Ludovico tear is created when it passes through Multidimensional Baby, at the start of every room, and persists like the Ludovico tear itself. However, it cannot be controlled; it instead slowly follows Isaac.\n*** {{dlc|r}} The extra tear stays completely still where it appeared.\n* {{i|Notched Axe|nr}}: The Ludovico tear cannot be moved while Notched Axe is held up.\n** {{dlc|r}} The tear can be moved by swings, without any special effect happening to it.\n* {{i|Proptosis}}: The closer the tear floats to Isaac, the larger it is. The farther away, the smaller.\n* {{i|Pupula Duplex}}: Decreases the tear size by taking the form of a Pupula Duplex tear; however, it travels faster.\n* {{i|Sinus Infection|nr}} / {{t|Nose Goblin|nr}}: The tear can occasionally stick to an enemy. If the enemy does not die quickly, the tear pops and a new one appears.\n** {{dlc|r}} Like Explosivo, no longer sticks the original Tear to the enemy, instead places a replacement booger, which deals the same damage.\n* {{I|Sulfuric Acid}}: The Ludovico tear occasionally becomes acidic and can destroy objects.\n* {{C|Tainted Lilith|r}}: {{I|Gello|n}} shoots a smaller Ludovico tear which disappears if he retreats back into Lilith.\n* {{i|Technology 2|nr}}: The tear controls as usual, and Isaac fires the laser towards the tear relative to his position, rather than in the direction the player is moving the tear. Technology 2's damage penalty still applies. The laser becomes spectral.\n** {{Dlc|r}}Technology 2's tears penalty applies instead of damage.\n***'''Technology 2''' + {{i|Analog Stick}}: Laser is fired directly at the tear while it is being moved, instead of being limited to cardinal directions.\n* {{i|Technology Zero}}: No effect without additional items. Extra tears orbiting the main one or familiar tears will generate arcs to the controlled tear.\n* {{i|The Wiz}}: A smaller Ludovico tear will appear and revolve around the main one. Also, the Ludovico tear moves diagonally, up is up-right, down is down-left, left is left-up, right is right-down. This can be counteracted by holding the keys or d-pad in its associated path (up-right to make it go up and so forth with the other keys).\n* {{i|Tiny Planet}}: Tear orbits around Isaac, however, the orbit can be grown or shrunken, sped up or slowed down by using the firing keys.\n* {{I|Tough Love}} / {{T|Jawbreaker}}: Tear occasionally flicks to being a tooth, which deals 3.2x Isaac's tear damage, before immediately returning to being a normal tear. The frequency at which the tear very briefly transforms into a tooth increases with [[Luck]], permanently becoming a tooth at 9 Luck. {{T|Jawbreaker}} does not change the tear appearance.\n* {{i|Trinity Shield}}: The controls of the tear and the shield overlap, making it impossible to consistently control both.\n*{{i|Tropicamide}}: No size increase effect. Ludovico tear size scales with damage, and not with size multipliers.\n\n==In-game Footage==\n{{#ev:youtube|U56p5_2nvkQ}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Ludovico Technique is a reference to Anthony Burgess' novel [[wikipedia:A Clockwork Orange|''A Clockwork Orange'']] and Stanley Kubrick's [[wikipedia:A Clockwork Orange (film)|film adaptation]], where it was referred to as \"Ludovico's Technique.\" The technique involved headgear which forced the patient's eyelids open (hence ''\"Controlled Tears\"'') while watching violent films under nausea-inducing drugs, conditioning them against violence.\n*It is possible to control the tear with the mouse, just open the <code>options.ini</code> file in <code>C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\My Games\\Binding of Isaac Repentance</code> and change <code>MouseControl=0</code> to <code>MouseControl=1</code>.\n*The sound of firing a tear with The Ludovico Technique can be heard in the splash screen of a boss room, before it is possible to control your character.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:The Ludovico Technique.jpg| Concept art for The Ludovico Technique.\n</gallery>\n\n==Seeds==\n{{plat|PC}} KPRZ M83V (First floor Treasure Room)\n{{plat|PC}} ZYS1 ONMS (Treasure Room adjacent to spawn)\n{{plat|PC}} VLZW 7CJ8 (Treasure Room adjacent to spawn)\n{{plat|PC}} {{dlc|a}} {{mode|normal|hard}} MX26 V47J (Treasure Room adjacent to spawn)\n{{plat|PC}} {{dlc|a}} KYSL MRKZ (Treasure Room adjacent to spawn)\n{{plat|PS4}} S11S E632 (First floor Treasure Room)\n{{plat|Vita}} 0H0T MKNS (First floor Treasure Room)\n{{plat|3DS}} DQBE T9RH (First floor Treasure Room)\n{{plat|3DS}} GEYN TXS7 (First floor Treasure Room)\n{{plat|3DS}} KK92 7DTD (First floor Treasure Room)\n{{plat|Switch}} 191Z NVJA (Treasure Room adjacent to spawn)\n{{Plat|Switch}} PNWHFSMH (First floor Treasure Room)\n\n==Bugs==\n{{bug|dlc=anr|Mom's Knife + {{i|Technology}}: Creates an uncontrollable laser ring centered on Isaac.

This has the following notable effects:\n** {{dlc|nr}} If Isaac's Speed or Tear delay are already at their internal soft caps (2.00 and 5 respectively), items that increase them specifically will give no stats.\n*** The only exception would be items that decrease tear delay, and then only if Isaac's tear delay isn't at the hard cap of 1.\n** {{dlc|r}} If Isaac's tears stat has reached the soft cap corresponding to 5 [[fire rate]], basic tears ups no longer add bonuses, only direct tear delay upgrades will. Likewise, direct fire rate increases have no effect if the absolute maximum of 120 has been reached.\n*** Speed adjustments, despite the stat being bounded between 0.1 and 2.0, always have an effect. \n**{{Dlc|r}} Speed and range will positively scale as they increase; the higher these stats already are upon receiving a boost to either one, the bigger the boost to the rest of Isaac's stats. Range scales especially quickly, making large range upgrades like {{I|My Reflection}} and {{I|Tiny Planet}} very powerful with Libra. \n** Items that apply multipliers to Isaac's tear delay ({{i|Mutant Spider}}, {{i|Brimstone}}, {{i|Dr. Fetus}}, etc.) can be fired more rapidly with less damage.\n** Damage upgrades become less effective. In return, speed and range upgrades now increase damage and tears.\n** Items that affect the stats of Isaac's tears after they're fired ({{i|A Lump of Coal}}, {{i|Blood Clot}}, {{i|Proptosis}}, etc.) do not go through the balancing formula and work as normal.\n* {{dlc|nr}} Libra's balancing formula values tear delay higher than the other stats and damage less than the other stats. This makes standard tears ups give more stats than a standard range or speed up, and standard damage ups give less stats than a standard range or speed up.\n* {{dlc|r}} Generally speaking, if an item increases Isaac's damage per second, Isaac will receive a stat bonus. If the item lowers fire rate and increases damage, or vice versa, in a way that results in loss of DPS, Isaac's stats will go down.\n* {{dlc|nr}} Since tear falling speed is not involved in the calculations, items such as {{i|Mini Mush}} or {{i|Kidney Stone}} that increase tear falling speed but lower range are mostly detrimental.\n*Stat upgrade [[pills]] have more utility, providing bonuses long after their stat could be usefully increased.\n**In order of effectiveness, the pills are: ''Range'', ''Tears'', then ''Speed Up''.\n**{{I|Placebo}} with stat upgrade pills provides a constant source of stat increases.\n\n== Synergies ==\n*{{I|Berserk!}}: For some reason, as you gain more kills while berserk, Libra steadily increases the damage, tears, and range stat with seemingly no limit, allowing massively high DPS, but targets are much more difficult to hit as the range of the swing gradually extending outwards more and more with each kill.\n* {{I|Soy Milk}}: As tear delay is valued very highly by the formula, greatly increases all stats.\n**{{dlc|r}} Soy Milk is only a minor DPS upgrade, and as such a very minor all stats up.\n*{{I|Ipecac}}: Can be rapidly fired with decreased damage.\n*{{I|Rock Bottom}}: Stats will increase as a result of items, get locked at the highest point, and then be balanced out via Libra allowing items like Ipecac and Soy Milk to have higher damage/shot speed respectively.\n*{{I|Taurus}}: Gradually increases all stats in an incomplete room. Libra prevents Isaac from becoming invincible (unless with high stats), and stat increases will remain until the end of the fight.\n*{{T|Tape Worm}}: As range is valued very highly by the formula, greatly increases all stats. Synergizes well with {{I|Mom's Box}}.\n**{{dlc|r}} Tape Worm is a flat +3 range instead of x2, resulting in only a small all stats up.\n\n==Interactions ==\n* {{i|Almond Milk}}: Almond Milk is only a minor DPS upgrade, and as such a very minor all stats up.\n*{{i|Cricket's Body|nr}}: Due to how Libra values tear delay, Cricket's Body gives an overall stat downgrade or upgrade depending on Isaac's internal base tear delay: At 7 or less it increases stats, at 8 or more it decreases stats.\n*{{i|D8}}: D8's stat changes depend on which stats end up with which multipliers and their base values. Range has a high weight and is uncapped, and thus can result in a massive boost if it scores a high multiplier. Damage is also uncapped but, on the other hand, has a low weight.\n**{{dlc|r}} The changes in Libra's formula mean D8 is very likely to give a small all stats up, its magnitude depending on Isaac's other items and which stats were emphasized.\n*{{i|Dark Arts}}: Libra is extremely detrimental to how Dark Arts works, and should not be used together: The speed boost during the invincibility phase is transferred into attack bonuses (Which are useless as tears cannot be used), and afterwards, the temporary damage boost is divided across all of Isaac's stats, resulting in very negligible stat boosts.\n*{{i|Epiphora}}: The stat bonus for continuously firing in one direction applies to all stats. The accuracy penalty is unaffected.\n* {{i|Eve's Mascara}}: Gives an overall stat downgrade, due to tears being weighted heavier than damage.\n**{{dlc|r}} Eve's Mascara is a DPS up with no other relevant stats, and as such is a small all stats up.\n*{{i|Experimental Treatment}}: The greater number of stat upgrades compared to stat downgrades results in an effectively guaranteed all stats up. Health, Shot Speed, and Luck are still subject to chance.\n* {{i|Purity}}: At base stats, the tear delay and damage aura give a greater stat bonus than the range or speed aura.\n**{{dlc|r}} All the auras grant a small all stats up of similar magnitudes.\n*{{I|Succubus}}: When in the aura, affects re-balanced stats rather than just damage.\n*{{i|Technology 2|nr}}: Doubled tear delay due to firing out of only one eye is unaffected by the balancing formula.\n*{{I|Tiny Planet}}: The significant range increase results in a large stat boost to speed and tears and a small boost to damage. However, the decrease in range causes orbiting tears to no longer complete a full 360\u00b0 lap around Isaac, instead dropping off at about half that.\n\n==In-game Footage==\n{{#ev:youtube|jDWmZchX4pM}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*The symbol of the scales is based on the Scales of Justice held by Themis, the Greek personification of divine law and custom.\n*Libra gives 6 bombs, 6 keys, and 6 coins, a potential reference to the Number of the Beast (666).\n\n==Seeds==\n{{plat|PC}} F4C8 CPWM (First floor Treasure Room)\n{{plat|PC}} G3VX ADL3 (Treasure Room adjacent to spawn)\n{{plat|PC}} FJGQ 16DZ (First floor Treasure Room; second floor Treasure Room contains soy milk for synergy.)\n{{plat|PC}} LME3 1YAY (Treasure Room adjacent to spawn)\n{{plat|PC}} LVK4 LE8W (First floor Treasure Room)\n{{plat|PC}} {{mode|hard}} 39EQ E7Q2 (First floor Treasure Room two left of spawn; Treasure Room two right of spawn contains [[Soy Milk]] for synergy)\n{{plat|PS4}} PEBQ QMMW (Treasure Room adjacent to spawn)\n{{plat|PC}} {{dlc|a}} {{mode|hard}} 3GMP EP3E (First XL Floor Treasure Room adjacent to spawn; [[Soy Milk]] in treasure Room of next floor)\n{{plat|PC}} {{dlc|a+}} RXPJ 0GCX (Treasure Room adjacent to spawn)\n{{plat|Switch}} CQWB 0CFV (First floor Treasure Room)\n{{plat|Switch}} T2AE MZW1 (Treasure Room adjacent to spawn)\n\n{{nav|zodiac}}",

Given the item's single room charge, this makes for an extremely powerful synergy.\n**{{Dlc|r}} Brimstone does not benefit from Tammy's Head's flat damage bonus anymore.\n*{{I|Tech X}}: Tech X has priority. Does not apply Brimstone's tears down. Fires a Brimstone ring.

The 1.5x damage multiplier from Brimstone + Technology is retained.\n*{{I|Tiny Planet}}: The beam will wrap around Isaac once and then shoot straight forward.\n**If combined with My Reflection, the beam will first wrap around Isaac, form an oval beam in a longer range, then shoot backward. Interestingly enough, the beam will look like a G clef symbol.\n*{{I|Uranus}}: The beam will freeze any enemies killed by it, so long as they are not immune to the freeze effect.\n*{{T|Wiggle Worm}}: Beam becomes wavy while firing straight, effectively increasing its width.\n\n==Interactions==\n\n*{{Dlc|na}}{{I|20/20}}: Overridden by Brimstone.\n**{{Dlc|a}} Adds a second Brimstone.\n*{{I|8 Inch Nails}}: Beams gain knockback, pushing enemies away in the direction they travel but not out of their path.

A high tears stat can increase the minimum damage dealt, but decreases the maximum damage dealt.\n**{{Dlc|r}} At 30.00 fire rate or above (0 tear delay or lower), charging is no longer needed. Higher fire rate results in higher tear damage. At 120.00 fire rate, tears deal 4x Isaac's damage.\n*{{Dlc|nr}} Tears down: Delay * 2.5.\n\n== Notes == \n* Repeatedly pressing a key to fire allows Isaac to fire as quickly as the key is pressed, up to the equivalent of a maxed tears stat. This is not generally recommended, as overall damage per second is greatly reduced.\n**Rapid-fire can be useful for dealing with low-health enemies, for whom DPS is less relevant, or chance based tear effects.\n\n== Synergies ==\n* {{i|20/20}}/{{i|The Inner Eye}}/{{i|Mutant Spider}}: Fires multiple charged shots.\n* {{i|Compound Fracture}}/{{i|Cricket's Body}}/{{i|The Parasite}}: Split tears do half the damage of normal tears.\n* {{i|Godhead}}: Charging the shots increase the size and damage of the aura.\n* {{transf|Guppy}}: Firing quickly generates lots of Blue Flies, which each deal 200% of your tear damage.\n* {{i|Haemolacria}}: Increased tear delay. Completely charged shots and their burst tears are larger and deal higher damage than normal. Chocolate Milk also allows low-damage Haemolacria shots to be fired rapidly.\n*{{Dlc|nr}}{{i|Isaac's Tears}}/{{i|Sad Bombs}}/{{i|Tammy's Head}}: The size and damage of all generated tears correspond to the current charge level of Chocolate Milk. Isaac's Tears will nearly instantly recharge while charging a Chocolate Milk shot.\n**{{Dlc|r}} Charge level does not effect generated tears. Isaac's Tears recharge only when a shot is fired.\n* {{i|Ipecac}}: Increased tear delay. Charged shots deal massively increased damage, as the +40 damage from Ipecac is run through the damage multiplier of Chocolate Milk. It also allows low-damage Ipecac shots to be fired rapidly.\n* {{i|Lachryphagy}}: Rapidly firing small, uncharged tears can cause the fed tear to grow into a gigantic tear that will still deal fairly low damage while feeding tears with charged tears will result in higher-damage tears.\n*{{Dlc|nr}}{{i|Mom's Wig}}: Spiders rapidly spawn while charging.\n**{{Dlc|r}} Spiders spawn only when a shot is fired.\n* {{i|Monstro's Lung}}: {{dlc|nr}} Reduces Isaac's current tear delay by 20%, allowing Monstro's Lung to charge faster. Each tear from Monstro's Lung is also a charged Chocolate Milk shot, massively increasing damage.\n** {{dlc|r}} Tear delay is increased, and the tear damage, along with the amount of tears fired is dependent on charge time.\n* {{i|Polyphemus}}: Increased tear delay. Massively increases the damage of each shot, and charged tears decay in damage much slower as a result.\n* {{i|Sinus Infection}}: Booger damage is influenced by the damage of the individual tear, so fully-charged Chocolate Milk shots can result in very potent damage over time.\n* {{i|Technology 2}}: Damage dealt by the laser is equal to Isaac's current charge, leading to constant high damage from a safe distance.\n** {{Dlc|r}} The laser deals 13% of Isaac's damage regardless of charge, tears are affected by Chocolate Milk as normal.\n* {{i|Trisagion}}: Fully charged beams deal four times normal damage. Trisagion's shots are colored brown.\n* {{c|The Forgotten}}: When charging the club, instead of being thrown, the club grows bigger, doing more damage.\n\n== Interactions ==\n* {{i|Anti-Gravity}}: No effect, but retains the reduced tear delay.\n* {{dlc|nr}} {{i|Brimstone}}: Doesn't increase damage, but reduces Isaac's current [[Tears#Tear Delay|tear delay]] by 20% (allows Brimstone to charge faster). Beam is colored brown. It also applies to {{C|Azazel}}'s default mini-brimstone.\n**{{dlc|r}} Brimstone laser takes longer to fully charge, but can be released at any point during its charge. Width and damage of the laser increases at higher charges. Width scales from 50% at minimum charge to 160% at maximum charge. Damage scales from 25% at minimum charge to 250% at maximum charge. Unlike with normal tears, the tears stat does not directly affect maximum or minimum damage.\n* {{i|C Section|r}}: Overrides Chocolate Milk.\n* {{dlc|nr}} {{i|Cursed Eye}}: The charge bar only indicates the current charge for Chocolate Milk, not for Cursed Eye; the latter's charge is determined by the eye's glow. If charged until Cursed Eye fully glows, Isaac fires one Chocolate Milk shot, followed by up to three minimal power ones.\n** {{dlc|r}} Cursed Eye takes longer to charge, but low damage shots can be fired rapidly. If fully charged, Isaac fires five Chocolate Milk shots.\n* {{dlc|nr}} {{i|Dr. Fetus}}: Bombs can't be charged, but reduces Isaac's current tear delay by 20% (allows Dr. Fetus to fire faster). Bombs are brown.\n* {{dlc|nr}} {{i|Epic Fetus}}: Missiles can't be charged, but reduces Isaac's current tear delay by 20% (allows Epic Fetus' missiles to be fired with a shorter delay between them). Changes the explosion color to brown.\n* {{dlc|nr}} {{i|The Ludovico Technique}}: The tear can't be charged, but reduces Isaac's current tear delay by 20% (allows The Ludovico Technique to deal damage faster). Turns the tear into a Chocolate Milk tear.\n* {{dlc|nr}} {{i|Mom's Knife}}: Doesn't increase damage, but reduces Isaac's current tear delay by 20% (allows Mom's Knife to charge faster). The knife turns brown.\n* {{i|Marked}}: Isaac will automatically charge his shots. Fire rate increases when the crosshair is closer to Isaac, and damage increases when the crosshair is farther from Isaac.\n* {{i|Mega Blast}}: Firing the Mega Blast beam while Chocolate Milk charges preserve the charge, but does not increase the beam's damage.\n* {{i|Neptunus}}: Overrides Chocolate Milk's active charge. Tear damage is determined by how charged Neptunus is.\n* {{dlc|nr}} {{i|Soy Milk}}: Overrides Chocolate Milk, but Isaac gains a flat +1 damage bonus after the Soy Milk damage penalty.\n**{{dlc|r}} Shoots moderately charged shots at a quick pace with no increase in damage.\n* {{dlc|nr}} {{i|Technology}}: Lasers can't be charged, but reduces Isaac's current tear delay by 20% (allows Technology to fire faster). Lasers are colored brown.\n**{{dlc|r}} Lasers can be charged, dealing up to 4x damage when fully charged. Low-damage lasers can also be fired rapidly. Tear delay isn't decreased.\n***At 30.00 fire rate or above (0 tear delay or lower), charging is no longer needed and lasers deal 4x damage.\n* {{dlc+|anr}} {{i|Tech X}}: Doesn't increase damage, but reduces Isaac's current tear delay by 20% (allows Tech X to charge faster).

This will result in Dead Cat reviving Isaac back inside the Devil Room.\n* {{dlc|a}} Taking Dead Cat as {{c|Keeper}} or {{c|Tainted Keeper|r}} will reduce their total number of Coin Hearts to one, meaning they will die upon taking any damage at all. Unless either of them have immediate access to an HP Up item, taking Dead Cat is usually detrimental.\n* {{dlc|r}}Holding onto a {{P|XIX - The Sun?|n}} can be beneficial if at high HP.

(cannot reproduce, can anyone provide insight?)--> \n* {{dlc|a+nr}} This item counts as 9 items, so if Isaac is trying for an early portal to {{s|The Void}} after beating {{E|Mom}}, this will significantly boost the progress closer to 20 items.\n* {{Dlc|r}} If {{c|Jacob and Esau}} take the item, only the brother who takes it will be set to one Red Heart Container on pickup.

The character doesn't gain the Damage Up or Tears Down effects.\n**{{dlc|a+nr}} Isaac shoots Ipecac tears while charging Brimstone. Both Brimstone and Ipecac shots modify Isaac's damage and tear delay stat, meaning that Ipecac fires slower and Brimstone charges slower, but Brimstone does an extra 40*13 damage.  Take care to pre-charge Brimstone so that the Ipecac shot is on cooldown as Isaac enters a room.\n**{{dlc|r}} The flat damage bonus is reduced to +2, but Isaac's tear rate stat is not modified. The beam explodes on the first enemy or obstacle it hits every other tick, dealing 10 + twice of Isaac's Damage. The explosions do not occur when the beam narrows, meaning that they occur only twice per shot without {{I|Soy Milk}} / {{I|Almond Milk}}.

Damage greatly increases as the flat damage bonus stacks with Epic Fetus' explosive multiplier.\n*{{i|Flat Stone}}: The Ipecac shots cause full-damage explosions instead of lesser splash damage when they bounce off the floor, though they can also harm Isaac.\n**{{Dlc|r}} Each bounce creates an explosion that deals half Isaac's damage as well as dealing the regular splash damage. The bounce explosion radius is slightly larger than the splash radius.\n*{{dlc|a+}}{{c|The Forgotten}}: The flat damage bonus is reduced to +4.

The explosions occur 8 times and deal 10 + twice of the laser's damage.\n*{{i|Tech X}}: The flat damage bonus is reduced to +4. The laser ring becomes poisonous.\n**{{Dlc|r}} The flat damage bonus is reduced to +2. The laser ring becomes poisonous and explodes every other tick on contact, deal 10 + twice of the ring's damage. Knockback from the blasts will push enemies along the path of the ring, prolonging damage. The ring will not open {{R|Secret Room}}s.\n*{{i|Technology}}: Removes the flat damage bonus, poisonous laser.\n**{{dlc|a+nr}} +4 flat damage bonus, poisonous laser.\n**{{Dlc+|r}} +2 flat damage bonus, poisonous laser that explodes on enemy or obstacle contact, deal 10 + twice of Isaac's damage.

Rapid-fire can be used against weaker enemies or to clear obstacles when necessary.\n* {{i|Cricket's Head}} / {{i|Eve's Mascara}} / {{i|Magic Mushroom}}: The damage multipliers from these items apply to Ipecac's +40 bonus, unlike others.\n*{{dlc|nr}} {{i|Death's Touch}}: Although damage is increased, the tears' hitboxes also grow larger which may be detrimental.\n*{{I|Fire Mind}}: Due to the nature of the Ipecac, all shots will have a 100% chance of leaving a fire at the center of the explosion. {{dlc|nr}} It will also no longer leave behind green creep and the explosion will be of normal color instead of green.\n*{{dlc|nr}} {{i|Ghost Pepper}}: If a fire is generated at the same time as an Ipecac shot, the Ipecac shot will explode instantly.\n* {{i|Glass Cannon}}: As the Glass Cannon tears are so large, even a modest damage increase or a single tear size increasing item is likely to render the tear unable to damage enemies.\n*{{Transformation|Guppy}}: Blue Flies are no longer spawned on hit.\n**{{dlc|a}} Ipecac shots spawn Blue Flies on hit, both direct and indirect.\n*{{I|Holy light}}: A beam of light will spawn on top of any enemy within the explosion's radius.\n*{{i|Jacob's Ladder}}: The sparks spawn only when they hit a wall.\n* {{i|Little Horn|force=nr}}: If an Ipecac shot has the Little Horn effect, after destroying an enemy, it loses its explosive property and effectively is just a normal Little Horn tear.\n* {{i|Lost Contact}}: Ipecac shots will explode on contact with enemy shots.\n* {{i|Mom's Eye}} / {{i|Loki's Horns}}: Occasionally shoots backwards or in all 4 directions, with high risk of self-damage.\n* [[Piercing tears]]: Tears will still explode on enemy contact, nullifying piercing.\n* {{i|Rubber Cement}}: Tears will bounce off walls and rocks and won't explode until they hit the ground. Not recommended, as self-damage is likely.\n* [[Spectral tears]]: Ipecac shots no longer explode on contact with obstacles or walls, making accidental self-damage less likely but it's more difficult to open secret doors.\n*{{c|Tainted Forgotten}}: Tainted Forgotten's melee attacks will explode. Tainted Soul is immune ''only'' to those explosions, and any further explosions caused by synergies will damage it.\n*{{dlc|nr}} {{i|Technology 2}}: The +40 damage bonus is not affected by the Technology 2 multiplier making the laser very high powered, but only every other Ipecac shot is fired.\n* {{i|Technology Zero}}: High fire rate needed for explosive shots to be connected.\n* {{i|Tiny Planet}}: Ipecac tears orbit around Isaac for a very long time. They land far enough to not cause self-damage, but that can be relied on only if Isaac is not moving and do not hit enemies.\n* {{i|Tractor Beam}}: The Ipecac tear will travel in an arc along the beam, even if Isaac is moving forward as well. When Isaac changes direction, the tear will snap to the beam, making it very easy to accidentally hit close objects blocking its new path.\n\n== In-game Footage ==\n{{#ev:youtube|Tr2kLXcBzDg}}\n\n== Unlockable [[Achievement]]s ==\n{{achievement|Lil Spewer|text}}\n\n== Trivia ==\n* \"Ipecac\" is a shortened name for [[wikipedia:syrup of ipecac|syrup of ipecac]], a powerful emetic (a substance used to induce vomiting).

This is just a visual effect.\n** {{dlc|r}} 166 damage is required for screen shake.\n** {{dlc|r}} A big enough tear size (~827 damage with no other tear size modifiers) will cause the explosion sound to change to the one used by {{i|Mama Mega!|n}}.\n* This item is used in {{chal|Suicide King}}.\n\n== Seeds ==\n{{plat|PC}} 2Q6M EEZQ (First floor Treasure Room)\n{{Plat|PC}} MTGB 0GKY (First floor Treasure Room)\n{{plat|PC}} BK3W 93F4 (Treasure Room adjacent to spawn)\n{{plat|PC}} NNH2 XPNP (Treasure Room adjacent to spawn)\n{{plat|PC}} {{mode|normal}} Q47Z GX3W (Treasure Room adjacent to spawn)\n{{plat|PC}} C139 L97X (Treasure Room adjacent to spawn)\n{{plat|PC}} {{mode|hard}} 8R72 734X (Treasure Room, 2 rooms left of spawn)\n{{plat|PC}} TDC8 CJTS (Treasure Room adjacent to spawn)\n{{plat|PS4}} HYDG 0PPY (First Treasure Room)\n{{plat|PS4}} {{dlc|a+}} 0ACX C07T (First Treasure Room)\n{{plat|Vita}} 3N3B BFWZ (Treasure Room adjacent to spawn)\n{{plat|Switch}} 7KHL 4SEL (First Treasure Room)\n\n{{nav|moms heart unlock}}\n[[category:tear-modifying items]]",

Damage downgrade applies as normal.\n* {{i|Ipecac}}: The very fast rate of fire fills the screen with low damage explosions.\n* {{Dlc|nr}} {{i|Libra}}: Decreases fire rate slightly, but massively increases damage, range, and speed. Tear height is also massively increased, meaning tears can hit enemies through obstacles without spectral effect.\n**{{dlc|r}} Resets stats to slightly higher than base level.\n**{{dlc|r}} '''Libra''' + {{i|Brimstone}}: Constant Brimstone beam at normal/higher damage.\n* {{i|Lost Contact}}: Extremely effective at blocking shots.\n* {{i|A Lump of Coal}}: Significantly increases tear damage as they get further away.

Non-fully charged rings can still be fired by releasing the fire key during charging, but much harder due to the high fire rate and removal of charge bar.\n* {{i|Technology Zero}}: The near-constant stream of tears will have electricity chained between them, providing an electrical net of damage making it almost impossible to not hit an enemy.  This can greatly help offset the lowered damage by increasing the number of hits.\n\n== Interactions ==\n* {{i|Almond Milk}}: Overrides Soy Milk (no additional effect on tears or damage).\n* {{i|Epic Fetus}}: Damage of missiles will be decreased accordingly, but unlike normal tears, there is still a fixed timed delay between firing missiles.\n*{{i|Kidney Stone}}'s charge time is not affected.\n*{{dlc|r}} {{i|Mom's Knife}} No special synergy. Charge bar still disappears, but knife will not be automatically released upon full charge.\n*{{Dlc|nr}}{{i|Proptosis}}: The low-damage, lowered size tears disappear extremely quickly, greatly reducing range.\n**{{Dlc|r}}Tears no longer dissappear instantly.

(Unless Isaac is carrying the {{T|Short Fuse}} trinket, in which case the bomb will explode before the invincibility state returns)\n\n== Notes ==\n* While invulnerable, {{E|Little Horn}}\u2019s pitfall still affects Isaac and will teleport him throughout the room; however, the damage is not dealt.\n* With items like {{i|Cube of Meat}}, Isaac can easily, but slowly, kill most enemies and bosses without taking any damage.\n\n== Synergies ==\n\n*{{I|7 Seals}}: One of the more versatile familiars that works with Gnawed Leaf.  The varied forms and attacks of this familiar make it capable of clearing pretty much any room given time.  The locusts it produces often fly to Isaac which takes care of chasing enemies, but its damaging creep and chasing attacks can reach even the farthest enemies. \n*{{I|120 Volt}}: With enough damage, 120 Volt's zaps becomes far more efficient at killing than orbitals.\n**At 15 damage minimum, it surpasses most orbitals.\n**At 30 damage or more, it surpasses {{I|Sacrificial Dagger}}.\n*{{I|Angry Fly}}: Aggressively attacks enemies even if they're far away, but can end up harmlessly orbiting slow or stationary enemies indefinitely, or trying to attack invulnerable enemies.  It does better with slow or stationary bosses than regular enemies, diving in to attack periodically instead of harmlessly orbiting.\n*{{i|Daddy Longlegs}}: Allows Isaac to easily clear most rooms or bosses while in statue form. Daddy Longlegs cannot damage bosses like {{E|The Shell}} and won't target enemies that are a long distance from Isaac. In a pinch, {{T|mom's toenail}} works the same, albeit much slower.\n*{{I|Damocles}}: If Isaac is in statue form when the sword falls, he will survive.\n*{{I|Dark Arts}}: While Isaac is surrounded by enemies, he will not take damage and will safely go into the shadow state. (Even if enemies are in pointblank range.)\n*{{I|Decap Attack}}: The head can be used on stationary bosses to wither them down.\n*{{i|E. Coli}} /{{i|Midas' Touch}} /{{I|serpent's kiss}} / {{i|The Virus}}: Monsters touching the statue will be affected without Isaac taking collision damage.\n*{{I|empty vessel}}: if Empty Vessel's requirement is fulfilled, Isaac can safely wait for the shield to activate, allowing to deal damage without leaving invulnerability.\n*{{I|IBS}}: Orbitals and other things(such as 120 Volt) can trigger IBS while in statue form, however, Isaac will still be invincible. This can be really good if a Stinky Poop is held above his head.\n* {{i|Kamikaze!}}: Statue form will break, but the initial explosion will not damage Isaac, therefore granting Isaac quasi-unlimited bombs.\n* {{i|The Ludovico Technique}}: The hovering tear will still deal damage and the statue form won't break as long as the attack buttons aren't being pressed.\n** '''The Ludovico Technique''' + {{i|Strange Attractor}}: Can pull enemies in while remaining a statue, clearing out rooms easily.\n* {{i|Mom's Knife}}: The knife can damage enemies while Isaac is a statue.\n*{{Dlc|r}}{{I|Mom's Heels}}: While invincible, Isaac can still deal contact damage.\n*{{I|Monstrance}}: The aura makes quick work of chasing enemies.\n* {{i|The Pinking Shears}}: Isaac's body will attack enemies while his head is invincible.\n* {{i|Placenta}}: Isaac can safely regenerate Red Hearts in any room, making it easy to have enough health from any mistake at the cost of time.\n* {{i|Robo-Baby 2.0}}: Since it fires automatically, this familiar is one of the more effective synergies, since it will even shoot off screen as it\u2019s knocked around.\n*{{I|Salvation}}: The aura can trigger from nearby enemies while Isaac is safely a statue, and the damaging beams when this happens can reach farther enemies.  This powerful attack can make quick work of bosses that chase Isaac.\n*{{I|Spin to Win}}: Gnawed Leaf will activate while using Spin to Win, as long as Isaac is stationary. This allows for a brief moment of high damage against enemies that chase Isaac.\n* {{i|Sprinkler}}: Can be placed upon entering a room, and will continue to fire when Isaac is invincible, meaning any room can be cleared without the risk of Isaac taking damage. This theoretically allows end-game bosses to be beaten without having to move.\n* {{t|Super Magnet}}: Pulls enemies into Isaac, can be extremely powerful if combined with orbitals that allow contact damage.\n*{{dlc|r}}{{C|Tainted Magdalene}}: Tainted Magdalene's \"Hug\" attack still triggers when in the statue state without taking damage, making short work of aggressive enemies as well as providing lots of healing.\n* {{dlc|r}}{{C|Tainted Forgotten}}: The Soul is invincible as long as the bone club is not used and The Forgotten is not thrown, even if The Soul is holding The Forgotten and moving around.  Combined with orbitals that deal contact damage like {{I|Cube of Meat}} or items that can trigger damage only by movement such as {{I|Purgatory}}, can make for a trivial method to beat any boss.\n*{{Transformation|Yes Mother?}}: When worst comes to worst and Isaac has no orbitals or familiars, the knife can be used to deal damage, due to how common the transformation is.\n* {{i|Tooth and Nail}}: Allows one second to act and/or reposition without taking damage. Useful in situations such as ranged combat when enemies bombard from a distance, or to attack and move to a safe distance where Isaac can safely regain statue form.\n\n==Interactions==\n\n*{{I|2spooky}}: Counterintuitive and should be avoided, as most enemies will never approach orbital range.\n*{{i|Blood Oath}}: Standing still at the start of a level will block Blood Oath's damage, preventing it from activating.\n*{{i|Blood Rights}} / {{i|IV Bag}} / {{i|Razor Blade}}: Statue invulnerability will not prevent damage from these items when activated.\n*{{I|Book of Virtues}} / {{I|Lemegeton}}: Wisps are invincible while invulnerable.\n*{{c|Jacob and Esau}}: If Esau picks up the item, he can remain invulnerable even when Jacob is moving but not when firing.\n*{{i|The Gamekid}} / {{i|My Little Unicorn}} / {{i|Unicorn Stump}}: Statue form can activate while invulnerable.\n*{{T|Short Fuse}}: Bombs explode before invincibility kicks in.\n\n== In-game Footage==\n{{#ev:youtube|iKOnwnkZrv4}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*This item is a reference to the [http://www.mariowiki.com/Super_Leaf Super Leaf] from ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', which grants the player the [http://www.mariowiki.com/Tanooki_Suit Tanooki suit].

One group travels clockwise and the other travels counterclockwise.\n* {{i|Loki's Horns}}: Effectively grants a great tear multiplier, as the extra tears from Loki's Horns will follow the trajectory given by the Tiny Planet.\n*{{i|Lost Contact}}: Shielded tears will orbit Isaac, granting a partially successful 360-degree projectile protection around him. Works better with a faster fire rate.\n*{{i|A Lump of Coal}}: This item drastically increases the screen time of tears because it makes them orbit around Isaac for a few seconds.

Very powerful as the tears are not destroyed upon damaging an enemy. When near walls, the orbiting tears tend to get stuck against the walls until Isaac moves away.\n*{{i|Spirit Sword|r}}: The sword's melee attack becomes disjointed from Isaac, hitting in an increased range in front of him but creating a blind spot where the strike used to be.

However, with large shots (Death's Touch with high damage, for instance) this combo can fill the entire screen with projectiles almost immediately.\n* {{i|Sprinkler}}: Tears made by Sprinkler will follow Isaac\n* {{i|Tech X}}: Overrides Tiny Planet.\n* {{i|Tractor Beam}}: Overrides Tiny Planet but keeps the large range increase.\n** '''Tractor Beam''' + {{i|Rubber Cement}}: Tears will travel along the beam until they hit a wall and then orbit Isaac.\n** '''Tractor Beam''' + {{i|Dr. Fetus}}: Tractor Beam is ignored and plain Dr. Fetus interaction applies.\n* {{t|Wiggle Worm}}: The tear forcefully orbits while spiraling.

This can greatly increase accuracy but depending on enemies' movements and positions can also damage Isaac.\n* {{i|The Parasite}}: Enemies will be pulled towards both fired tears and split tears. However, because they both travel in opposite directions, the split tears' magnetic effects tend to cancel each other out.\n* {{i|Rubber Cement}}: Due to tears being reflected, enemies tend to be pulled towards Isaac with much force.

From ''Rebirth'' onwards, an exhausted item pool will instead spawn {{I|breakfast}}, even if the item would normally never spawn from that item pool and/or Breakfast had already been obtained in the run.\n* In programming \"Undefined\" refers to an unknown value.\n* Given the Glitch theme of the item and the ability to access [[Chapters]] that have not yet been unlocked using {{R|I AM ERROR}}, along with the ability to acquire mass upgrades in The Chest and The Dark Room, it is possible that it was intentionally made into a powerful sequence-breaking item.\n* The sprite for Undefined appears to be, fittingly, a glitched and spliced version of other item sprites, with the bottom right part noticeably being the {{I|the compass}}, the bottom left being the {{I|blood bag}}, and the top half being {{I|contract from below}}. This may also be a reference to Undefined's sprite in the original ''The Binding of Isaac''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:3DS Detailed Undefined.png|{{plat|3DS}} The icon of Undefined as seen on the lower 3DS screen\n</gallery>\n\n==Seeds==\n{{plat|PC}} TRP0 FE16 (first treasure room, adjacent to spawn)\n{{plat|PC}} 9YDH V6SL (first treasure room, adjacent to spawn)\n{{plat|PC}} F189 W42E (first treasure room, adjacent to spawn.

The low shot speed makes beams damage enemies more frequently.\n*{{i|Tech X}}: Tech X benefits from a lower shot speed due to it staying on enemies longer and is also not affected by range, giving little downsides.\n** {{Dlc|r}} The tears down can be a major downside as it takes longer to charge Tech X and the damage dealt by Tech X is less than Isaac's damage when it is not fully charged.\n\n== Interactions ==\n* {{i|Diplopia}}: The damage and tear multipliers do not stack.

The door to {{Stage|Mausoleum}} / {{Stage|Gehenna}} is not affected.\n* Picking up a non-orbital familiar will cause either Isaac's Heart or the other familiar to be layered over the other's sprite.

Look out for enemies that fly or can jump over rocks, and make sure enemies don't push Isaac far away from his heart to expose it.\n* When dodging, Isaac must move in semi-straight lines as the heart only follows Isaac's movements when he is at a certain distance away, for example, moving in a circle would pull the heart in and make it stay in place in the middle of the arc as Isaac would no longer be moving away from the heart. Moving in a triangle formation would allow the heart to move more.\n* Enemies that fly and charge like {{E|One Tooth}} are extremely hard to dodge and should be killed as soon as possible, take caution since they can appear as early as {{s|Caves}} / {{s|Catacombs}}.\n* Enemies can be pushed away with Isaac's body, while not recommended, it can be used as a last resort.\n* {{Dlc|r}}To avoid taking damage from {{E|Mega Troll Bomb}}s, push into them while firing at them, instead of running away. \n\n== Synergies ==\n* {{i|120 Volt}}/{{i|Monstrance}}: These items become much safer to use offensively as they are centered around Isaac's body which no longer takes damage.\n* {{i|Box of Friends}}: Box of Friends does not duplicate the heart, making it safe to use.\n* {{dlc|nr}}{{i|Breath of Life}}: Isaac can be infinitely invulnerable, as invincibility carries out to the heart without hurting the player.

Enemies touching the heart can still do damage, and picking up the babies after the heart will cause the heart's hitbox to be checked first against shots.\n*{{t|Gigante Bean}}: Increases the knockback amount and radius of the heart when fully charged. Highly useful.\n*{{i|King Baby}}: The Heart will follow King Baby.

Missing No.] glitch occurring in the first Pok\u00e9mon games. The glitch would often corrupt save files, and therefore randomize various parts of the game as it would use the incomplete index values attributed to entities not included in the final release of the game. Isaac's appearance when affected by Missing No. is based on this glitch which could cause the player's sprite to become scrambled.\n* The item also resembles the painting \"Composition II with Red, Blue, and Yellow\" by Dutch painter [[wikipedia:Piet Mondrian|Piet Mondrian]].\n* The background color for the Missing No. achievement has the same color as all the challenge unlocks. This implies that Missing No. was originally intended to be unlocked via a challenge. (Or, perhaps, it was intended to be looked at as an error.)\n**The background color for the {{A|Suicide King}} achievement has the same color as all the boss rush unlocks.

It will not become a Ragling after being released, and only chases enemies by rolling.\n* {{dlc|r}} Captured {{E|Bishop|n}}s will protect Isaac with their shield generation ability, as well as all other friendly enemies. Isaac cannot take any damage while the Bishop is alive, as it will protect him with the shield. Protecting the Bishop can be a powerful defensive tool, especially when playing as {{C|The Lost}}.\n** The shield does not protect against instant death effects such as {{p|Suicide King}} or {{i|Plan C|x}}.\n* {{dlc|r}} Captured {{E|Cultist|n}}s will revive killed enemies as friendlies, allowing one to slowly amass an army of friendlies by protecting the Cultist.\n** Bosses and degraded bosses can be revived by a friendly Cultist, but will not persist between rooms.\n\n== Synergies ==\n* {{I|The Battery}}: Walking over a captured enemy will double charge the ball, allowing the enemy to be released, and allowing to catch a new one in the same room, and the process repeats. This allows the Friendly Ball to be used much, ''much'' more often, and gathering many more friends.

This Troll Bomb deals contact damage and leaves a patch of fire similar to {{I|Hot Bombs}} that cannot damage him.

Isaac can still fall into the pits and be transported around the screen, and will ''appear'' to suffer damage, but no actual loss of HP will occur if he is in statue form when he falls in.\n* The Dark Balls that Little Horn spawns can appear in [[Closets]] in the {{Stage|Caves}} and the {{Stage|Flooded Caves}}. They also appear in a room with Little Horn in the {{Stage|Chest}}.\n* If Isaac has the {{t|Safety Scissors|n}}, he can acquire maximum bombs from the fight at fairly little risk since the bombs Little Horn spawns will turn into bomb pickups and all his hole attacks are easy to dodge.\n* Little Horn's Dark Ball is considered a monster. Killing it will activate items such as {{i|Charm of the Vampire}}, {{i|Infestation 2}}, and {{i|Jar of Flies|n}}.\n* Occasionally, a Pitfall that Little Horn summons will not vanish after defeating the boss.

Examples include {{i|Cube of Meat}} after defeating one of [[The Harbingers]] as a floor boss, or {{i|the Small Rock}} after breaking a [[Tinted Rock]].\n\n== Notes ==\n* When playing [[Greed mode]], items that are available only in the normal game will still not appear despite Chaos; the modes' different item pools stay separate.\n* As the item does not mix or combine item pools, it is possible to deplete smaller item pools and end up with {{i|Breakfast}} before all items in the game have been taken.\n** Thus, if Chaos tries to pull from an item pool that is already depleted, it will not pull from a different pool and instead give Isaac Breakfast.\n*** As many Greed Mode item pools are small, Chaos tends to result in Breakfast more often during Greed mode.\n* {{dlc|nr}} Chaos will draw items even from item pools that are not used in the game, but defined in the game's files. The unused pools are <code>bossrush</code> containing nearly all bomb related items, <code>challenge</code> with a smaller selection of bomb items and <code>dungeon</code> containing several Mom related items and food items.\n* {{dlc|nr}} Since all item pools have the same probability of being selected, bomb-related items are much more common due to the [[Bomb Bum (Item Pool)|Bomb Bum]], <code>bossrush</code> and <code>challenge</code> item pools.\n* {{dlc|r}} Each pool has a weight based on the number of items in the pool. Items from large pools such as [[Treasure Room (Item Pool)|Treasure Room]], [[Shop (Item Pool)|Shop]], and [[Boss (Item Pool)|Boss]] are very likely, while items from small pools like [[Bomb Bum (Item Pool)|Bomb Bum]] and [[Planetarium (Item Pool)|Planetarium]] are more rare.\n* If an item outside of the [[Devil Room (Item Pool)|Devil Room pool]] appears as a [[Devil Deal]], it will always cost 1 Red Heart Container (or 3 Soul Hearts should Isaac have no Red Hearts).\n** {{dlc|r}} If an item from the [[Angel Room (Item Pool)|Angel Room pool]] appears as a [[Devil Deal]], it will cost 2 Red Hearts if it would cost 30 cents in the Angel Shop generated by {{i|The Stairway}}, and 1 Red Heart if it would cost 15 cents in the Angel Shop.\n*** Similarly, if an item from the [[Devil Room (Item Pool)|Devil Room pool]] appears in an Angel Shop generated by {{i|The Stairway}}, it will cost 30 cents if it would cost 2 Red Hearts as a [[Devil Deal]], and 15 cents if it would cost 1 Red Heart as a [[Devil Deal]].\n*If an item that grants an {{E|Eternal Heart}} is taken in a devil deal, the eternal heart will ''not'' keep Isaac alive if he has no other hearts.\n* {{dlc|a+}} Bosses defeated in {{s|The Void}} drop items as if Chaos was active. Re-rolling the items uses the Boss Room pool as normal.\n\n== Interactions ==\n* {{i|Sacrificial Altar}}: Ignores Chaos's effect and always picks items from the normal [[Devil Room (Item Pool)|Devil Room pool]], even on Greed Mode.\n\n== In-game Footage ==\n{{#ev:youtube|1dFn-T_G5l8}}\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The item's sprite is a [[wikipedia:Symbol of Chaos|Symbol of Chaos]].\n* The character appearance is similar to the \"Trollface\".\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Forgottenwithchaos.PNG| {{c|The Forgotten}} gains a unique appearance from Chaos.

This allows the player to have practically infinite attempts to keep their loadout of passive items.\n*{{Dlc|r}}If a use of Glowing Hour Glass by {{C|Tainted Lazarus}} involves changing to his other form - either due to room completion or by using {{i|Flip}} beforehand, Glowing Hour Glass's charges will not be consumed.

If you have the {{t|Safety Scissors}}, these can be harvested as normal.\n*{{i|Duality|r}}: The doors to the {{R|Devil Room}} and {{R|Angel Room}} stay open if you use the Glowing Hour Glass inside their rooms, so Duality lets you check the items of one of them before deciding which room to use.\n*{{I|Alabaster Box}} + {{I|Schoolbag}}: Using Glowing Hour Glass before the Alabaster Box opening animation is complete will return the box to you while still opening it, allowing for infinite uses of Alabaster Box.\n*{{I|Luna}}: Activating the beam of light in the secret room and going back in time before isaac raises Luna above its head will give Isaac the tears and half a soul heart while the beam of light will still stay untouched in the secret room, allowing for multiple uses of the same beam of light.\n*{{i|Eraser}}/{{I|Notched axe}} + {{i|Schoolbag}}: Using Glowing Hourglass to return to the previous stage will keep the charge received from entering the next stage.\n*{{I|Empty heart}}/{{T|maggy's faith}}/{{T|hollow heart}}: Going back to the previous floor will not remove empty heart containers/white/bone hearts that were obtained in the process.\n*{{I|redemption}}: Going back to the previous floor before Redemption will finish its animation will make it activate on the previous floor without wasting itself, allowing for multiple uses.\n**You will need to reenter boss room to get the bonus second time.\n*{{i|More Options}}: If used after entering the Treasure Room for the first time, upon reentering the room, the items may change.\n*{{i|Crooked Penny}} + {{i|Schoolbag}}: If there is infinite battery and an item in the same room, you can multiply items an infinite number of times.

Every time you succeed a flip, you must leave the room and enter it again to \"save\" your progress.\n**{{dlc|r}}You must also activate the Crooked Penny in another room between each failed attempt.\n*{{i|Saturnus}}: Using the Glowing Hourglass will activate the effect of Saturnus again, essentially allowing for double the amount of orbiting tears, if the player returns to a room, where the tears created by Saturnus were not destroyed.\n*{{Dlc|r}}If activated while under the effect of  [[Soul of Azazel]], as long as you had the consumable in the previously visited room, you will keep the Megablast effect while having another copy of the soul in your inventory.\n\n==Interactions==\n*{{i|Bag of Crafting}}: The bag's contents will be reverted to its previous state.\n*{{i|The Battery}}: Glowing Hour Glass will receive a maximum of two full charges as normal, however, using the item twice consecutively will not result in the player being teleported two rooms previous, only one. This means that if Glowing Hour Glass is used twice in succession, they will rewind as normal with the first use to the previous room, then, upon second use, everything will be rewound, but the player will not be teleported to the room previous to the one they just teleported to and will instead find themselves teleported to the room they are currently in. Rewinding works as normal, but teleportation is limited to the last room visited.\n*{{I|Car Battery}}: No effect.\n*{{i|Void|force=a+nr}}: It is impossible to absorb a Glowing Hour Glass pedestal without using the item and preventing it from having been absorbed.\n**{{Dlc|r}} The Glowing Hour Glass is absorbed like normal. Subsequent uses of '''Void''' send Isaac back to the previous room reverting most changes, nullifying many other effects that '''Void''' may have absorbed. Energy is still reset back to full upon each use, allowing for infinite re-tries of any room. This does, however, prevent you from consuming any further powers as you will instead reset the room. \n***Notably, the {{i|Broken Watch}} triggers the slow effect on every fourth room, based on the room counter which does not reset on use, allowing you to undo a fast room and get all slow rooms.\n***The {{i|Placenta}} re-rolls regeneration at the minute mark, allowing you to re-roll entering a new room shortly before the minute mark and almost guarantee a regeneration (mind the one-second animation tick on the clock).\n* {{C|Tainted Jacob}}: Using this item in a room where Dark Esau has spawned will cause him to remain with the player after teleporting, but once enough time has passed he will suddenly disappear and respawn elsewhere.

In the case of Lazarus' Rags, though, the completion mark will go toward Lazarus and not the character originally selected.\n****Similarly, if playing as {{C|Tainted Lazarus}}, using Plan C and then using {{I|Flip}} to switch to the other form pauses the death counter until the player switches back to the form that originally used the item.\n***It is possible to kill Delirium by carefully timing pauses after each screen static. Each screen static plays a cutscene that continues to play even while paused, so by pausing and unpausing at the right timings, Delirium's death animation can be shortened to just under 3 seconds allowing for his completion mark to be awarded.\n**{{dlc|r}} Will not work if used against {{E|Ultra Greedier}} as {{C|Tainted Forgotten}}, {{C|The Lost}}, {{C|Tainted Lost}}, or {{C|Tainted Jacob}} in his lost form.\n**{{dlc|r}} Killing {{E|Mother|n}}'s second phase with Plan C will kill Isaac just at the end of her death animation. No completion mark is awarded.\n**{{Dlc|r}} If used in {{E|The Beast|n}} battle, Plan C will only kill the harbinger that Isaac is fighting on screen. It won't have any effect on the other harbingers nor The Beast itself (The Beast can still be killed if Isaac is fighting it when Plan C is used, and there is enough time to earn the completion mark).\n* Invulnerable enemies and closed {{E|Host}}s will not be killed by Plan C.\n* Isaac's last will shows his last damage source as the cause of death, not Plan C. If Isaac has not taken damage or lost health from any source, Isaac's face is shown.\n* Invincibility or the {{I|Holy Mantle}} shield will not save Isaac from being killed.\n* Some items that activate when Isaac reaches zero hearts, such as {{I|Heartbreak}} and {{I|Spirit Shackles}}, will not activate, killing Isaac.\n* Even if Isaac enters a trapdoor immediately after using Plan C, he will still die after arriving at the next floor.\n** Isaac will also die after accepting a [[Victory Lap]] or performing a [[RERUN]].\n* Plan C has an 80% decreased item pool weight, making it less likely to appear than other collectibles.\n* Plan C is found in 8 item pools, the second highest count amongst all items, behind {{I|Cube of Meat}}.

Contact with an enemy while a glitched tear is on-screen will fling Isaac to a corner of the room. This can potentially cause a softlock if Isaac is blocked by obstacles and does not have {{i|How to Jump}} or flight to escape.

This can cause tears to quickly fill the room.\n* {{i|Godhead}}: Tears gain a damaging aura and become damaging aura fields.\n** '''Godhead''' + {{i|A Lump of Coal}}: Tears will quickly fill up the screen and increase in damage, easily killing any enemy.\n* {{i|Haemolacria}}: Tears fire a burst of smaller tears in random directions when hitting an obstacle or stopping and falling to the ground.\n* {{i|Immaculate Heart}}: Tears that orbit Isaac will be constantly moving and therefore will never disappear until they hit an enemy or Isaac leaves the room. Filling the orbit with enough tears can potentially cause a chaotic, vibrating ring of eyeballs enveloping Isaac as the tears constantly collide with one another.\n* {{i|Ipecac}}: Tears do not arc and will instead shoot straight. They retain their explosive abilities on impact with enemies or obstacles, or when they eventually fall.  Tears also do not explode when bouncing off of each other, which can be used to propel the high-powered tears to other enemies.\n* {{i|Lead Pencil}}/{{i|Monstro's Lung}}: Removes the arcing effect from the tears, greatly increasing air time. The tight cluster the tears are shot in will cause unpredictable spread, however.\n* {{i|A Lump of Coal}}: Tears will increase their damage and size as they travel, and they are not limited by range.\n* {{i|My Reflection}}: Tears constantly swarm around Isaac, quickly filling the room.\n* {{i|The Parasite}}: When tears hit an enemy, obstacle, or wall, they split into many smaller tears that have the same behavior as eyeball tears.\n* {{i|Rubber Cement}}: Allows tears to never disappear when hitting enemies and objects, increasing the uptime of tears greatly.\n** '''Rubber Cement''' + '''A Lump Of Coal''': Tears continuously increase in size and damage as they bounce endlessly around the room. Eventually the damage can be enough to kill bosses in a single frame.\n* {{dlc|r}} {{i|Tech.5}}/{{i|Technology}}: The laser's range is drastically reduced, and an eyeball is created at the end of the laser each shot.\n*{{dlc|r}} {{I|Tiny Planet}}: With enough tears and/or fire rate, the Pop! tears can constantly collide with each other, causing them to orbit Isaac indefinitely.\n\n== Interactions ==\n* {{i|Angelic Prism}}: The Prism will split eyeballs that it passes over.\n* {{Dlc|nr}}{{c|Azazel|Azazel}}/{{i|Brimstone}}/{{i|Technology}}: Lasers override Pop!.\n*{{I|C Section|r}}: Fetuses' movements do not extend their lifespan, it is still limited by Range.

Occasionally causes Trisagion beams to stay static in the air for a few seconds, dealing damage to enemies that come in contact with them.\n* {{i|Godhead}}: Although the damaging aura isn't visible, it still exists and is not affected by Trisagion's damage reduction. Still grants homing effect and shot speed down which can be very beneficial.\n* {{transf|Guppy}}: As it hits multiple times, it spawns multiple flies per tear making it very strong.\n* {{i|Haemolacria|nr}}: Both Trisagion and Haemolacria fire at the same time; Isaac's tears do not keep the spectral attribute despite the sprite being changed. The tears keeps their piercing effect.\n** {{dlc|r}} Haemolacria becomes one big Trisagion beam that splits into more beams when it reaches its max range.\n* {{i|Hemoptysis}}: Enemies hit by the sneeze will gain a curse that increases the damage the blasts deal to 0.66x and +3 flat damage (instead of just x0.33). Enemies who die to the blasts under the curse will damage and spread the curse to nearby enemies. Since the flat damage ignores the multiplier, this is a huge increase to Isaac's damage.\n** Hemoptysis + {{i|Soy Milk}}/{{i|Almond Milk}}/{{dlc|r}}{{i|20/20}}: The flat damage increase ignores the multiplier reductions, which results in a massive increase in damage.\n* {{I|Head of the Keeper}}: Each tick of damage has a chance to drop coins greatly increasing the amount of coins that would usually drop.\n* [[Homing tears]]: Tears slow down and stay on top of the enemy, doing continuous damage.\n* {{i|Jacob's Ladder|r}}: Small electric arcs generate from the blast every tick.\n* {{i|The Ludovico Technique}}: The beam becomes controllable, still dealing reduced damage but at a very high rate.\n* {{i|Mucormycosis}}: The spore effect can stack multiple times on the same enemy.\n* {{i|My Reflection}}: In addition to the usual effect, lengthens the Trisagion blasts into short flexible beams for a much larger damage-dealing area.\n* {{i|Mysterious Liquid}}: Causes a large trail of creep. The effect stacks, which causes heavy damage (even to {{e|Hush}}).\n*{{I|Ocular Rift}}: Creates multiple rifts as the projectile pierces enemies.\n* {{i|Pop!|r}}: Every damage tick will shoot out a Pop! tear. Trisagion shots will also hover in the air longer than normal.\n* {{dlc|nr}} {{i|Proptosis}}: Base damage is increased by the expected amount and beam damage is boosted to about 65%. Blasts lose no power as they travel further, though the tips of the blasts deal very slightly less damage.\n** {{dlc|r}} Blasts now deal 2x Isaac's damage instead of 0.33x. Damage only slightly decreases in the front of the blast.\n* {{I|Spirit Sword}}: The sword will shoot Trisagion beams instead of energy beams, with the Trisagion beams having increased damage.\n\n== Interactions ==\n* {{C|Azazel}} / {{i|Brimstone}} / {{i|Dr. Fetus}} / {{i|Epic Fetus}} / {{i|Mom's Knife}} / {{i|Tech X}} / {{i|Technology}}: Overrides Trisagion.\n* {{i|Compound Fracture}}: Split blasts are not generated on hitting enemies, only on obstacles and walls.\n* {{I|Cricket's Body|nr}}: Split blasts are not generated on hitting enemies, only on obstacles, walls, and the floor.\n* {{i|C Section|r}}: Overrides Trisagion.\n* {{Dlc|nr}}{{i|Dead Eye}} / {{i|Euthanasia}} / {{i|Eye of Belial}} / {{i|Explosivo}} / {{i|Holy Light}} / {{t|Nose Goblin}} / {{i|Parasitoid}} / {{I|Sinus Infection}}: Overridden by Trisagion.\n* {{i|Fire Mind}}: Tears still ignite enemies, but no longer have a chance to explode.\n* {{dlc|nr}}{{i|Flat Stone}}: Blasts continually disappear and reappear as they \"bounce\". The bounces deal 25% splash damage based on Isaac's base [[damage]], but the blasts cannot do their damage while they're disappearing, leading to an overall reduced efficiency.\n** {{dlc|r}} Blasts no longer disappear.\n* {{i|Ipecac|nr}}: Beams will now travel through obstacles and maintain their piercing effect dealing 33% of regular damage to enemies they come in contact with, but won't explode on hit. The Ipecac explosion will happen once the beam runs out of range or hits a wall and will deal damage equal to Isaac's damage.\n**{{Dlc|r}} Keeps Ipecac's stats and shoots an exploding Trisagion beam. The beam explodes while in contact with an obstacle or an enemy that it does not kill on the first tick, resulting in an excellent synergy with {{I|Pyromaniac}} or {{I|Host Hat}}. One tick of the beam deals 33% of Ipecac's damage to enemies, but the resulting explosion every tick deals full damage.\n* {{i|Jacob's Ladder|nr}}: Electric arcs are not generated on hitting enemies, only on obstacles and walls.\n* {{i|Lachryphagy|nr}}: The blasts will slow down and float like Lachryphagy tears and eventually burst, but can not consume each other.\n** {{Dlc|r}} Blasts have greatly reduced range, but constantly generates Lachryphagy tears, with one shot alone being capable of bursting a tear.\n* {{i|A Lump of Coal}}: Nearly no effect; increases damage by around 5% when the hit is dealt by the tip of the blast. Makes the blasts absorb light, making it difficult to see anything while {{Cu|Darkness}} is present.\n** '''A Lump of Coal''' + {{I|My Reflection}}: As the beam is longer, the amount of extra damage at the tip can be up to around 50%.\n* {{i|Multidimensional Baby}}: The baby cannot duplicate Trisagion blasts.\n* {{I|The Parasite}}: Split blasts are not generated on hitting enemies, only on obstacles and walls.\n* {{i|Playdough Cookie}}: Rather than applying the effect to each individual tear, all beams will share the same color and change simultaneously every tick.\n* {{i|Pop!|nr}}: The blasts will slow down and float like Pop! tears, but will not bounce off each other.\n* {{i|Technology Zero}}: Unless Isaac has shooting familiars, Technology Zero will not function.

Blood Puppy has 20 health and 90 [[Damage_Scaling|Armor]] (effective health is ~140-180).\n* After getting 25 more kills (40 total), the angry version evolves, gaining the following modifications:\n** Becomes much larger and deals 15 damage per tick instead of 7.5 (30 per second, or 180 per second while charging).\n** Destroys [[obstacles]] it runs into while charging.\n** Deals a full heart of damage to Isaac instead of half a heart.\n** Drops a {{E|red heart}} after every 10 kills instead of a half red heart.\n** Has 50 health instead of 20 (effective health is ~400-500).\n* Each boss killed by Blood Puppy counts as killing 4 enemies.\n\n== Notes ==\n* Blood Puppy appears in the [[Bestiary]] as a type of monster, if Isaac turns it back to normal after it becomes angry. This is required to complete the Bestiary.\n* Blood Puppy is not targeted by other familiars while it is angry.\n** [[Blue Fly|Blue Flies]] and other familiars that deal contact damage will still damage Blood Puppy if they happen to collide.\n* Since {{E|bomb}}s ignore armor, a single bomb will tame the Blood Puppy.\n* Stages 2 and 3 of Blood Puppy are an enemy for all intents and purposes, similar to {{E|Dark Esau}}.

It also deflects enemy projectiles, which can damage enemies who get hit, and launches a projectile regardless of Isaac's current health.\n** The circular swing deals 8x Isaac's damage +10, and the projectile created from it deals 4x Isaac's damage +4.\n** The charge time is based on Isaac's tears stat, at ~4x Isaac's normal tear rate.\n** While charging, the sword will damage the first enemy that contacts it. This will cancel the spin attack.\n\n==Notes==\n* Spirit Sword has the highest priority of all tear modifiers in the game, over {{i|Epic Fetus}} and {{i|Mom's Knife}}. It is also the only item that can override Epic Fetus.\n* Unlike most charge attacks, the direction of the attack can't be changed by pressing and holding a different attack button then releasing the old one. Instead, it will stay pointing the same direction until all attack buttons are released, either doing nothing or using the spin attack, or the sword touches and damages an enemy, dealing sword slash damage.\n* Spirit Sword can be used to open {{E|Spiked Chest}}s and Mimics without taking damage.\n* Range upgrades move the hitbox of the sword forwards, including the spin attack. Enough range upgrades can leave a large blind spot directly in front of the sword.\n* Only the projectile and spin attack are affected by tear rate, not the normal sword swing, meaning that items that increase damage but decrease tear rate, such as {{i|Polyphemus}} and {{i|Eve's Mascara}}, are much more effective when only using the swing. Additionally, items that do the inverse, such as {{i|Soy Milk}} and {{i|Almond Milk}}; are not as effective when only using the swing.\n* Spirit Sword will deflect {{E|Mother}}'s Fistula attack and will send it right back at her, entering a short sequence that allows to deal bonus damage, if executed correctly; see this [[Mother#Phase 1|page]] for more details.\n*Spirit Sword is overridden by the [[Blindfolded]] effect, as seen while playing as {{c|Lilith}} or in challenges like {{chal|Cat Got Your Tongue}}.\n*{{C|Tainted Lilith}}: The sword is held by the fetus and acts the same way as with other characters.\n*Having 30 tears performs the swing attack automatically.\n\n==Synergies==\n* {{i|20/20}}/{{C|Keeper}}/{{i|The Inner Eye}}/{{i|Mutant Spider}}/{{i|The Wiz}}/{{transf|Conjoined}}: Isaac spins one additional time for each extra tear, firing extra projectiles on each spin.

The projectile is now fired in an arc and splits on collision with enemies and obstacles.\n* {{I|Holy Light}}: Both the sword swing and the projectile can trigger Holy Light.\n* [[Tears|Homing tears]] (e.g. {{I|Spoon Bender}}): The projectile will be homing.\n* {{I|Isaac's Tears}}: The item fires normal tears but can be charged as fast as the sword can be swung. Doing a spin attack will fully charge Isaac's Tears.\n* {{I|Lachryphagy}}: The fired projectiles will combine and split.\n* {{i|Loki's Horns}}: Random chance upon swinging to have a sword in all 4 cardinal directions.

Touching the white fire place temporarily transforms Isaac into {{C|The Lost}}. Another room on the floor has a mirror, which Isaac can enter while a ghost.

Scattered across the floor are three yellow buttons that will repair pieces of the track. Once all buttons have been pressed, the minecart becomes rideable, which will take Isaac to an abandoned area, with Knife Piece 2 at the end. Picking up the Knife Piece will trigger a chase sequence in which {{E|Mother's Shadow}} will pursue Isaac through the corridor. Getting to the end of the area will seal it off.\n\n== Notes ==\n*While in the abandoned area, all of Isaac's items and consumables are removed. Extra Life items will not activate despite still visually appearing beside the health bar. However, any items with reroll protection will still function as normal. (This includes {{I|Knife Piece 1}} itself.)\n* This room, as well as the buttons to reach it, will only be generated if Knife Piece 1 was already collected.\n*The buttons can be bypassed with flight and 2 bombs to destroy the door. Upon exiting the room, the rail pathway will be built in order to prevent softlocks from using temporary flight methods such as {{I|The Bible}}.\n*If Isaac takes Knife Piece 2 and is somehow able to immediately leave the room before {{E|Mother's Shadow}} fully activates (usually by using {{i|Mama Mega!}} earlier in the floor), the rest of the sub-area will not have reset, and the doors leading to the exit will all be locked. This forces the player to re-enter the Knife Piece 2 room, which triggers ''another'' activation of {{E|Mother's Shadow}}, causing two instances of Mother's Shadow to pursue the player during the escape sequence.\n*It is possible to find a crawlspace as normal in this area, which will be the same crawlspace as any other generated on the normal floor. Entering the crawlspace will allow Isaac to use his normal items and consumables, but Mother's Shadow will also be present. Using any teleport card or item will teleport Isaac to a random room on the abandoned area map. Any items obtained while in this crawlspace will remain upon leaving the area, but will not be able to be used while in the abandoned area.\n**It is possible to softlock the run by entering a crawlspace with the key needed to escape the room. Upon leaving the crawlspace, the key will be gone.\n**Black market can be entered from the crawlspace. Going through the trapdoor there will end the pursuit and lead to Depths I (or alternatives). Isaac will keep all his items, including those bought in the market.\n*Unlocking the door to get to the Mausoleum version of {{E|Mom's Heart}} consumes the knife familiar.\n*It's possible (though useless) to acquire another Knife Piece 2 using {{i|Forget Me Now}} and {{i|R Key}}.\n\n{{nav}}",

Beggars or items from {{I|Alabaster Box}}).\n* After Isaac gets hit once with the item activated, at any time with only a brief warning, the sword may fall, instantly killing Isaac regardless of his health. The sword has a 1/10000 chance every 4 frames to fall, so on average, 50% of all Damocles runs will not drop the sword until after at least 15 minutes and 24 seconds have passed.\n** Self-damage (such as from a {{Machine|Blood Donation Machine}}, {{Machine|Devil Beggar}}, {{r|Curse Room}}, {{r|Sacrifice Room}}, or self-damage Active Items) does not count as damage taken for Damocles, and will not give it the chance to fall.\n\n== Notes ==\n* The chance for the sword to fall does not increase beyond the first hit taken.\n* Items from {{E|chest}}s will not be doubled, which greatly limits Damocles' benefit in [[Chapters#Chapter 6 .28Optional.29|Chapter 6]].\n** The exception to this is {{E|Mega Chest|display=Mega Chests}}, which will spawn one extra item alongside the 2 original items for a total of 3 items.\n* In scenarios that have multiple items to choose from (such as rare double {{r|Treasure Room}} layouts and {{r|Boss Rush}}), an additional set of items for Isaac to choose from spawns. Only one item from each set can be taken.\n* Having multiple Damocles active at once does not spawn additional items.\n* The only way Isaac can survive the falling sword is if he's invincible at the time it falls or, by technicality, with a respawn item. After the sword falls, extra items will no longer spawn.\n** Losing a life before the sword falls does not remove the sword or its threat.\n* Items with associated costs, like those in {{R|Devil Room}} or {{R|Shop}}, will not create additional items.

The following is a table for times Isaac could survive to after getting hit, along with the chances of reaching them:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"100%\"\n ! Time passed\n !

In ''Antibirth'', the more times Isaac would get hit, the higher the chance of Damocles falling became.\n* The item's appearance and effects are a reference to [[wikipedia:Damocles|''[the] Sword of Damocles'']], a story in which Damocles frequently praised King Dionysius's life of wealth and luxury, and is offered to switch places with Dionysius on the throne for a day to have a taste of his power. Damocles accepts, only to find that Dionysius had a sword hanging over his throne by a single horse hair to remind Damocles of the never ending threats to both themselves and their country that a ruler must deal with during their reign, causing Damocles to beg to give the throne back to Dionysius\n* Damocles can be seen hanging over Isaac's head on the ''Antibirth'' [https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3590313627_16.jpg album cover].\n* There are actually two different Damocles items in the game: one (item ID <code>577</code>) is the active item that Isaac can encounter, and the other (item ID <code>656</code>) is a hidden passive item that is given when the active Damocles is used and that carries out the item's effects. The passive Damocles cannot be encountered through any normal means, even via {{I|Spindown Dice}} or {{I|Death Certificate}}, nor does it appear in the collection grid. If spawned on a pedestal via the [[Debug Console]], collecting the passive Damocles will immediately put the sword above Isaac's head as if the active Damocles were used.\n\n{{nav|jacob and esau unlock|the lamb unlock}}",

Isaac comes back to life 10 seconds after this effect occurs if he doesn't take damage while in ghost form.\n** Isaac has [[flight]] in ghost form, but no [[Tear Effects#Spectral|spectral tears]] unlike other ghostly forms.\n** After this effect occurs, Spirit Shackles cannot activate again until Isaac gains a half or full {{E|Soul Heart}} or a {{E|Black Heart}}. Soul Hearts that are used to charge Spirit Shackles will not be added to Isaac's health.\n\n== Notes ==\n* When the Shackles are ready, their costume on Isaac's arms is light blue. When they are drained and cannot protect from death, they are gray.\n* The entire heart gained is used to charge the item, although only a half heart is required.\n** In the case of blended hearts, Spirit Shackles will only be recharged if the blended heart would give Isaac soul health.\n* If Spirit Shackles is uncharged, items that add soul hearts directly to Isaac\u2019s [[health]] (such as {{i|Rosary}}, {{i|Cancer}}, or {{i|Book of Revelations}}) will recharge Spirit Shackles and give one less soul heart.\n* Isaac will have invulnerability frames for 1/3rd of a second after reviving, allowing him to get off of spikes he stepped on if they were what killed him.\n* Spirit Shackles can be recharged while it is active, but it cannot re-activate until its effect ends.\n* When Isaac returns to normal, he will be placed where his body was.\n* If Isaac leaves the room while in ghost form, he will not be chained to anything and can move freely. He will also come back to life at his current location rather than where his body was left.\n** Isaac can be trapped by this if he's in the middle of a pile of rocks when this happens. This can be fixed by save-quitting, then continuing the run.\n* If Isaac dies while in ghost form and is brought back to life by a respawn item, he will have flight and spectral tears until it would normally be removed.\n* Spirit Shackles cannot activate in the [[Mirrored World]], nor can the ghost form given by it be used to enter the Mirrored World.\n*Spirit Shackles will trigger if a fatal [[Devil Room#Deals with the Devil|Devil Deal]] is taken.\n\n== Synergies ==\n* {{C|The Lost}}: Effectively acts as a rechargeable extra life, granting additional defensive measures on top of his inherent {{i|Holy Mantle}} and granting a use to normally useless Soul Hearts.\n*{{I|Magic Skin}}: When all hearts are converted to [[Health#Broken Hearts|Broken Hearts]], Isaac will be revived with half a soul heart, allowing many more uses with low health.\n\n== Interactions ==\n* {{i|Ankh}} / {{t|Broken Ankh}} / {{i|Judas' Shadow}}: Soul hearts given on respawn cannot recharge Spirit Shackles.\n*{{c|Bethany}}: Soul charges cannot be used to recharge Spirit Shackles.

They can toggle between The Forgotten and The Soul as normal while it's active, and the form that didn't \"die\" will have their normal health. Toggling from The Forgotten to The Soul will also create another body of The Forgotten that The Soul will be chained to in addition to the original body.\n* {{c|Jacob and Esau}} / {{c|Tainted Lazarus}}: The character that has Spirit Shackles must die for it to activate; if the other character dies, it will not activate. Only the character that has Spirit Shackles can recharge it.\n** In the case of Jacob and Esau, the brother that has Spirit Shackles will be chained to their dead body, while the one that doesn't can move freely. If either brother dies while Spirit Shackles is active, the other dies with them as normal.\n* {{c|Keeper}} / {{c|Tainted Keeper}}: Cannot be recharged by picking up soul hearts, as they are turned into blue flies while playing as them. Effects that would add soul hearts to health directly, however, can recharge it.\n* {{c|Tainted Forgotten}}: The ghost will spawn from Tainted Forgotten instead of Tainted Soul; it will be invulnerable, unable to move, and use the bone club instead of Tainted Forgotten. It can also be thrown, but will rapidly return to Tainted Forgotten due to being chained to them.

Certain glitch moves in that game can have names so long they run into the memory, corrupting it and causing glitchy effects, like the opponent's name becoming \"TMTRAINER\". A certain other glitch (commonly referred to as the [https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/ZZAZZ_glitch ZZAZZ glitch]) replaces the letters in the player's name with capital Zs except for every third letter.\n** The pickup quote for this item is defined as \"Isaac and his mother lived alone in a small house on a hill\", but in game it's shown with the pattern of Zs overlaid on top.\n** The music fading out and status effects being applied to enemies upon acquiring the item is another direct reference to the effects of TMTRAINER in ''Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue'', which fades the music out upon use until another song is triggered to play (assuming the game survives the effects), as well as applying burn and frozen statuses to enemy pok<u>\u00e9</u>mon.\n* The sprite for TMTRAINER itself is a heavily glitched version of Isaac's face, affected similarly to the face of {{c|Tainted Eden}} in menus. \n** For the TMTRAINER sprite in particular is a reference to how sprites corrupt in ''Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue'', especially after encountering glitch Pok\u00e9mon, by segmenting into strips, then rearranged, usually flipped around.\n* The effect of the item is similar to a \"Randomizer\" for other games.\n**The item's effect is a reference to an old randomizer mod that came out before ''Afterbirth+''<ref>https://discord.com/channels/123641386921754625/485133685881045014/830627113311928320</ref>.\n*This item is used in {{chal|DELETE THIS}}.\n**DELETE THIS will always be unlocked before TMTRAINER on any given file.

This Red Room can only be created when Isaac is in another Red Room adjacent to it, i.e. from branching off one of the {{r|Treasure Room}}.\n*** Isaac can enter Hush's room from this crack, but going the other direction will lead him to the Entrance Portal room.\n*** Strangely, Isaac also can't create Red Rooms adjacent to the {{r|Shop}} on this floor either.\n** Red Key can create rooms adjacent to most Boss Rooms in {{s|The Void}}, including {{E|Delirium}}'s room. This can be used to find a Boss Room door leading to what would be an empty space (though this may find {{E|Mr. Fred}} instead).\n** Red Key can create rooms adjacent to the {{r|Boss Room}} in the [[Mirrored World]] of {{S|Downpour}} / {{S|Dross}} II.\n**Red Key can create rooms adjacent to the {{r|Boss Room}} during [[Ascent]].\n* When Isaac enters any Red Room adjacent to the {{r|Ultra Secret Room}}, it immediately appears on the map along with the Secret Room jingle, and its door will automatically open.\n* If Isaac encounters a Red [[special room]], all of its doors will be its special theme doors.\n** All doors in a Red {{r|Curse Room}} still feature spikes, which will damage Isaac if he decides to enter/exit.\n** A Red {{r|Vault}}'s doors or a Red {{r|Dice Room}}'s doors each require two keys to open.

They will be reflections of the original floor's Red Rooms, and special rooms created in this way will still be empty.\n* Red Rooms can't be created around the {{r|Mine Cart Room}} of {{s|Mines}} / {{s|Ashpit}} II.\n** Red Rooms on these floors can contain the yellow buttons used to build the mine cart track, however these ones do nothing.\n* Red Rooms in [[Chapter 3]] can contain [[Rocks#Marked_Skulls|Marked Skulls]] even before the [[Ascent]] is unlocked.\n* When in {{s|Dark Room}} or {{s|Chest}}, their spawn room containing their respective chests can be created by Red Key. These will function as regular chests of their respective type.\n** New {{E|Mega Satan}} doors can't be found in these rooms.\n*Red {{R|Treasure Room}}s will be present in the [[Ascent]], and will not replace regular {{R|Treasure Room}}s.\n*If a red {{R|Sacrifice Room}} appears in the {{s|Dark Room}} and the player teleports via the 12th or higher sacrifice, the new Dark Room will be an exact copy of the previous Dark Room: layout, enemies, room drops, and even [[curses]].

The item's chance of replacing later items does not trigger, making it equivalent to {{I|Mystery Gift}}.\n** An extra item cannot be spawned when used with {{I|Car Battery}}.\n*{{c|Keeper}} and {{c|Tainted Keeper}} gain a [[Health#Coin Hearts|broken coin container]], reducing their effective health by 1.\n** {{c|Keeper}} can use it up to 3 times, and {{c|Tainted Keeper}} can use it up to 2 times before Magic Skin disappears. But if they have {{I|Deep Pockets}} and {{I|Greed's Gullet}}, or {{T|Mother's Kiss}}, they can use it more than 2~3 times. \n*** Although they can have 13 or more coin hearts in some environment, they still die when they have 12 broken coin heart containers.\n* If either {{c|The Forgotten}} or {{c|The Soul}} has 6 broken hearts by using Magic Skin, this item will disappear and they will instantly die. However, swapping character right after one of them reaches 6 broken hearts can prevent them from dying but permanently disable the one using it.\n* {{c|Tainted Lazarus}} is able to find Magic Skin while {{c|Dead Tainted Lazarus}} is carrying it, and vice versa.\n* {{P|? Card}} does not count toward Magic Skin's use limit. This is especially useful when playing as any of the 3 above characters.\n* Using Magic Skin after touching the {{E|White Fire Place}} in {{S|Downpour}} II/{{S|Dross}} II, or while using the Soul of The Lost soul stone will still add broken hearts for when the character is revived.\n*{{I|Heartbreak}} or {{P|VI - The Lovers?}} will add broken hearts, lessening maximum use of Magic Skin.\n* Isaac dies instantly if he has 12 broken hearts.\n* Dying and reviving using any item will remove one broken heart, preventing Isaac from dying immediately.\n* Broken heart containers can be removed by donating to a {{M|Confessional}}.\n*In Treasure Rooms with a blind item, if the known item is Magic Skin, it's almost guaranteed the blind item is not.\n\n== Synergies ==\n* {{bov}}\n* {{I|Car Battery}}: Spawns 2 items and adds 2 broken hearts (removing 2 heart containers or 4 soul hearts) with each use. Two broken hearts are added regardless of Isaac's remaining health. If Isaac already has 11 broken hearts and uses Magic Skin, it will only be used once.\n* {{I|Damocles}}: Spawns 2 items on every use instead of 1.\n* {{I|Dream Catcher}}: If Magic Skin has replaced the item in the {{R|Treasure Room}}, it will be shown in the dream sequence.\n* {{I|Esau Jr.}}: Since Esau Jr.'s health is separate from Isaac's, one character can use Magic Skin at no cost to the other. Future items will still be replaced when playing as the character that hasn't used Magic Skin.\n* {{i|Schoolbag}}: Isaac can keep Magic Skin in the inactive slot to prevent its respawning while still being able to use another active item.\n* {{I|Spindown Dice}}: Using Spindown Dice on Magic Skin 6 times turns it into {{I|R Key}}.\n** '''Spindown Dice''' + '''Schoolbag''': Allows Isaac to keep Spindown Dice between runs, allowing a theoretically infinite run with enough luck.\n\n==Interactions==\n*{{I|Genesis}}: Removes all broken hearts as well as items. Magic Skin can still replace items in the Genesis room.\n*{{I|Glowing Hour Glass}}: Recovers a broken heart when used after using Magic Skin, does not recover soul hearts overwritten by broken hearts, this can kill Isaac. Reentering the room and using Magic Skin will spawn the same item.\n*{{I|Lemegeton}}: Magic Skin can be spawned by Lemegeton if it has been used in the current run. As long as Isaac has this flame, Magic Skin will not respawn/replace items.\n*{{I|Metronome}}: Getting Magic Skin from Metronome has a chance to instantly apply the item replacement and spawn Magic Skin as an item pedestal.\n*{{T|NO!}}: Does not prevent Magic Skin from replacing items, despite it being an active item.\n*{{I|TMTRAINER}}: Prevents Magic Skin from replacing items, since future Magic Skins will be glitched.\n*{{I|Void}}: Absorbing Magic Skin does not prevent future items from being replaced, including items spawned by the absorbed Magic Skin. Additional Magic Skins can be absorbed, allowing multiple items to be spawned per use at the cost of adding more broken hearts.\n*Revival Items: If Isaac's health container is full of broken hearts, one of broken heart is removed and revived with specific half or one heart according to revival items.\n\n==In-game Footage==\n{{#ev:youtube|kktyMkp8mdE||inline}}\n{{#ev:youtube|GRWY_e0xJow||inline}}\n\n== Trivia ==\n* [[anti:Magic Skin|Magic Skin]] originates from the ''Antibirth'' mod.\n* The item is a reference to the book by French novelist Honor\u00e9 de Balzac called ''[[wikipedia:La Peau de chagrin|La Peau de chagrin]]'', known in English as ''The Wild Ass's Skin''.

He attempts to get rid of the skin, but it always finds a way to return to him.\n* This also may be a reference to the goatskin Jacob uses to trick his father Isaac into thinking he was Esau, thus giving him his blessing along with the divine right God had promised Abraham (Isaac's father), which included inheriting the promised land and having his bloodline bring forth the Messiah.\n\n==Seeds==\n{{plat|pc}} {{mode|hard}} 9LWB BQRD (Curse Room adjacent to spawn)\n\n{{nav|jacob and esau unlock|mother unlock}}",

This will be a tears upgrade unless Isaac already has a lot of tears upgrades.\n*** If playing as The Forgotten, the x0.5 fire rate modifier isn't applied, as he already has it.\n** Killing an enemy while \"Berserking\" increases Berserk's current duration by 1 second.\n** Killing an enemy grants very brief invincibility, preventing damage from exploding enemies.\n** Every enemy killed will also grant +0.4 [[speed]] until the effect ends.\n** Isaac is unable to [[Death|die]] while Berserk is active. He can be reduced to 0 [[Health|hearts]], but will not die until the effect ends.\n*** This does not apply to {{i|Damocles}}. The sword will kill Isaac even if Berserk is active at the time it falls.\n* This item charges when Isaac deals damage to enemies rather than by clearing rooms or picking up batteries.

The target being Suplexed, as well as nearby enemies, will receive 300 base damage that scales with Isaac's size. All other enemies receive 200 flat damage.\n* {{c|The Lost}} / {{c|Tainted Lost}}: This can allow either variant of The Lost to survive being damaged if it happens while Berserk is active. Despite having no visible health bar, their health is normally set to half a [[Health#Soul Hearts|soul heart]]. If they take damage while Berserk is active, they will not die if they are able to pick up a soul heart or half soul heart before the effect ends.\n* {{i|The Ludovico Technique}}: While under the Berserk state, you lose control of the Ludovico Technique tear, which can now be deflected by the jaw bone swing, bouncing off nearby walls and dealing damage to enemies.\n\n== Interactions ==\n* {{I|4.5 Volt}} / {{I|9 Volt}} / {{I|Jumper Cables}}: No effect.\n* {{I|Car Battery}}: Duration is only extended if no enemies are killed during the first half, thus only providing a benefit against bosses that can't spawn enemies.\n* {{I|Sharp Plug}}: Isaac will take damage without gaining any charges.\n\n== In-game footage ==\n{{#ev:youtube|hL5NOXddHiw}}\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The item's name, description, and effects are likely a reference to the Berserk power-up from the [[wikipedia:Doom_(1993_video_game)|''Doom'' franchise]].\n** The phrase 'rip and tear' is frequently used throughout the ''Doom'' franchise, and was first used in the 1996 ''Doom'' comic after protagonist Doomguy picked up the Berserk power-up.\n** In addition, Isaac's inability to die during the effect could be a reference to the common joke of the main character of the ''Doom'' franchise being \"literally too angry to die.\"\n** This item may also be a reference to a character Chicken from ''Nuclear Throne'' who, unlike other characters in the game, wields a katana and, upon losing all HP, instead of immediately dying, her head gets cut off and she can restore health in a short amount of time to stay alive before dying for good.\n** This item may also be a reference to the \"Rage Beyond Death\" ability with similar effects that Barbarians can gain in 5th edition ''Dungeons & Dragons'', as the original ''Isaac'' characters were modeled after character classes from the game.\n* The jawbone Isaac uses is a Donkey's jawbone, which is a reference to a passage from the Book of Judges in which Samson kills one thousand Philistines using only the jawbone of a donkey.\n** It may also be a reference to the item Donkey's Jawbone from ''Antibirth'' that didn't make the cut for ''Repentance''.\n** This event is also referred to by the pickup message for the {{P|Soul of Samson}} \u2014 \"Slay a thousand\".\n* This item's special synergy with {{I|Suplex!}} was inspired by a bug in ''Repentance'''s initial release where any enemy (including final bosses like {{E|Hush}} and {{E|Delirium}}) that Suplex! was used on as Berserk!'s timer was ending would be instantly killed.\n\n{{nav|tainted samson unlock|delirium unlock}}",

If Isaac walks through an enemy or bullet during this time, it freezes until the effect ends, then takes damage equal to 2x Isaac's [[damage]] plus a flat 3.5. If there are multiple enemies/projectiles caught in the attack, each consecutive attack deals an additional flat 3.5 damage. At the end of the effect, an area of effect blast is created, dealing more damage the more enemies or bullets were pierced during the effect.\n** The damage of the blast at the end of Dark Arts is equal to the sum of all damage dealt while dashing between enemies.\n*** Bullets walked through will still count for the final blast damage calculation, even though they can't be damaged.\n** When used as {{c|Dark Judas}} or {{c|Tainted Judas}}, for every enemy/bullet he walked through, he will gain a temporary +1 [[damage]] bonus, which wears off at a rate of -0.25 damage every half second.\n\n== Notes ==\n* The invincibility can be canceled early by firing tears (and hence receive the damage bonus early with Tainted Judas or Dark Judas).\n* If an enemy/bullet Isaac walks through dies or otherwise disappears before Dark Arts deactivates, they will not grant a damage bonus.\n* Orbitals that deal contact damage such as {{i|Forever Alone}} will still deal damage and potentially kill an enemy, while those that block shots like [[Familiar#Orbital_Familiars|Pretty Flies]] will still block and destroy projectiles. This is not generally recommended, as it will make it difficult to gain damage off of targets.\n** Dark Arts still works on reflected bullets, which may be beneficial.\n** Explosive projectiles will explode when destroyed by Dark Arts, unlike those destroyed by {{I|Lost Contact}}.\n* Isaac cannot pick up items or donate to {{M|Blood Donation Machine}}s or {{M|Devil Beggar}}s while Dark Arts is activated, but he can pass through {{r|Curse Room}} doors or over [[spikes]].\n*Dark Arts cannot open {{E|Spiked Chest}}s or {{E|Mimic Chest}}s while active, but standing on the chests when the effect ends will safely open them.\n*Isaac can still press {{E|Silver button}}s while Dark Arts is activated.\n* Dark Arts will trigger certain tear effects on enemies it damages, such as burning from {{I|Fire Mind}}.\n* Dark Arts is extremely effective against enemies with multiple segments such as {{E|Larry Jr.}} because it can affect each segment individually, greatly increasing damage.\n* Invincible enemies such as {{E|Stoney|display=Stonies}} and {{E|Stone Grimace}}s can still be affected and used to increase the damage.\n** {{E|Host}}s can be damaged and killed even while they are lowered and invincible.\n** Similarly, using Dark Arts on {{E|Scolex}}'s invulnerable segments will still deal damage, making the fight significantly easier.\n* Dark Arts can be a useful tool for {{C|Tainted Jacob}} to avoid colliding with Dark Esau, as the invincibility and stunning effects of the item fully work against him even if Esau charges at the player.\n\n== Synergies ==\n* {{I|120 Volt}}/{{I|Monstrance}}: These items stay in effect even while using Dark Arts, allowing Isaac to deal more damage to nearby enemies while invulnerable.\n* {{I|Aquarius}}: Due to the nature of Dark Arts, Isaac can easily damage enemies with the trail left behind.\n*{{I|Backstabber}}: Tagging an enemy from behind will apply Backstabber's effect.\n* {{bov}}\n* {{I|Camo Undies}}: If used at the start of a room, after Dark Arts' effect ends, Isaac re-enters the stealth mode given by Camo Undies.\n* {{I|Car Battery}}: Dark Arts will last twice as long, totaling at 2 seconds per use.

Dark Arts can also be used from invulnerability without taking damage.\n*{{I|How To Jump}}: Jumping over an enemy or projectile while Dark Arts is active will tag it.\n*{{I|Ipecac}}: Because Dark Arts' damage is scaled off of tear damage, Ipecac gives an extremely high damage boost to each Dark Arts hit, easily capable of destroying some early bosses in a single hit.\n*{{i|Kamikaze!}}: Kamikaze! can be activated without harm when using Dark Arts.\n*{{I|Mars}}: Isaac is able to dash while using Dark Arts, allowing him to reach more enemies in one use of Dark Arts while still dealing damage with Mars' dash.\n* {{i|Mom's Knife}}: Mom's Knife will still deal damage even while in Dark Arts, killing most weaker enemies and bosses easily.\n*{{I|Montezuma's Revenge}}: The corns created by Montezuma's Revenge can be caught by Dark Arts, and most will naturally, making each cast of Dark Arts give huge boosts of damage. The Brimstone beam created will also still be active while Dark Arts is active. \n*{{I|Pause}}: Activating Dark Arts will not cancel the effect, turning Pause into an instant room clear in most situations and an effective tool for damaging bosses.\n**{{I|Pause}} + {{i|4.5 Volt}}: Pause becomes an even more effective tool against bosses, as it can now be activated several times in the fight.\n**{{I|Pause}} + {{i|9 Volt}}: Pause can be used every room, making most of them very easy to clear.\n*{{I|Rock Bottom}}: Rock Bottom will prevent the damage bonus given to Tainted Judas or Dark Judas from decreasing, allowing him to keep the highest achieved damage bonus.\n*{{I|Taurus}}: Dark Arts' damage bonus will contribute towards Taurus' activation, allowing Isaac to become invulnerable much earlier.\n*{{Dlc|r}}'''Wisps''': Wisps cannot be destroyed while Dark Arts is in effect and still deal contact damage.\n\n== Interactions ==\n* {{i|Aries}} / {{i|E.

This is due to the item taking up a previously unused item id.\n* Two items are impossible to obtain with Spindown Dice:\n** {{i|Mom's Ring}}, as it has the highest ID of all items (without mods taking a higher number, etc).\n** {{I|Strawman}}, due to {{I|Dad's Note}} having immunity to being rerolled.\n*Defeating{{E|Delirium|force=er}} as most tainted characters will unlock an item that is similar to their gameplay characteristic.

Damage can only be dealt to Dogma by damaging the television in the center of the room. Any attacks towards Dogma itself causes a shield to briefly appear and block the attack. Dogma moves slowly towards Isaac leaving a trail of damaging [[Creep#Static Creep|Static Creep]] and has a variety of attacks:\n* Fires three consecutive radial bursts of 8 {{i|Godhead}} projectiles. If Isaac stands within the projectiles' auras for long enough, a {{i|Crack the Sky}} beam hits Isaac from above.\n* Fires four consecutive bursts of projectiles in groups of 1, 2, 3, and, 4 in each of the cardinal directions, with the overall pattern resembling a star. \n** Occasionally after firing the 4th burst, Dogma greatly slows down all the projectiles mid-flight, leaving them to float around slowly for a moment before vanishing. \n*** Dogma starts using this variant after losing around 60% of its HP, and performs it more frequently the lower its HP is.\n* Fires 3 consecutive waves of 3 to 4 projectiles each in random directions. When these projectiles land, they create thin, harmless rays that point towards Isaac and become damaging lasers after a few seconds.\n* Fires a static {{i|Brimstone}} beam that bends towards Isaac. This beam is always fired in the closest cardinal direction to Isaac and switches if Isaac moves closer to a different cardinal direction.\n\n=== Phase 2 ===\nAfter destroying the television, Dogma falls apart into a puddle of static, before rising out of it as an orb and growing two pairs of wings resembling a [[wikipedia:Seraph|Seraph]]. During this phase, Dogma continues to chase Isaac between attacks but becomes vulnerable and has completely different attacks:\n* Fires a spread of disorganized feather projectiles towards Isaac if he's to its left or right.\n* Summons a ball of light overhead which creates 16 to 18 harmless rays of light that point outwards and spin around the ball in random directions. After a few seconds, the rays stop moving and become damaging thin  beams, similar to the ones used by the [[Angel]]s. This pattern is repeated three times, then Dogma throws it, firing one last wave of 8 wider beams in the cardinal and diagonal directions before dissipating.\n** If the thrown ball of beams is slowed (by {{i|Stop Watch}} for instance), the 8 beams fire before being properly aligned.\n* Turns into a winged wheel resembling an [[wikipedia:Ophanim|Ophan]] and floats off-screen before charging back towards Isaac, continuing off-screen releasing a radial burst with three layers of feather projectiles with 12 feathers each near the end of the dash. It repeats this attack a total of 6 times.\n\nAs Dogma takes more and more damage during this phase, its Seraph form will occasionally flicker into various other forms, these include Isaac's head, a lamb's skull with a serpent in its eye, a fly, and a troll face with horns. This is a purely visual effect.\n\nWhen Dogma's HP reaches zero for the second time, it is destroyed as the whole screen fades to white before turning off like an old TV. Then Isaac is automatically given {{i|Dogma}} as the cutscene that introduces {{e|The Beast}} is played.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Dogma_ingame.png|Dogma in-game.\nFile:Dogma_television.png|Dogma's television.\nFile:Dogma_secondphase.png|Dogma in its second phase.\nFile:Dogma_secondphase_attack.png|Dogma resembling an Ophan.\nFile:Dogma_fx.png|The sprites that Dogma's second form can briefly transform into while at low health.\nFile:Dogma_Concept_1.png|Early concept sketches of Home, including Dogma's boss arena for Home along with {{e|Min-Min}}.\nFile:Dogma_Concept_2.png|Early concept sketches of Dogma itself and its boss arenas for Home.

Further details and an in-depth explanation may be found [[damage scaling|here]].\n\n== Notes ==\n*After the beginning cutscene, Dogma appears very close to Isaac, making it easy to immediately take damage.\n*Having a high speed is highly recommended for the second phase as the charge attack can be almost unavoidable with low speed.\n*{{i|Censer}} makes the second phase more difficult by reducing the space between feathers during Dogma's charging attack while not slowing Dogma itself. It is not recommended for this fight.\n*As the Dogma room is not counted as a Boss room, effects like {{i|Blanket}} will not occur in this fight.\n*If Isaac has triggered the beginning cutscene, re-entering the room will trigger the Dogma fight immediately.\n*Before beginning the fight, going out and back into the living-room repeatedly while holding {{T|Liberty Cap}} guarantees to get the best possible effect sooner or later, which can greatly help during the fight.\n*{{i|Evil Charm}} will prevent Isaac from being affected by Dogma's {{i|Godhead}} aura projectile attack in its first phase.\n*Any effect that lasts for one room won't remain after the fight and won't carry over to the [[Harbingers (Bosses)|Ultra Harbingers]] and The Beast fight.\n\n== Trivia ==\n*A \"dogma\" is most commonly defined as \"A set of rules, beliefs, or opinions laid down by a group, the members of which unquestionably follow\".\n**Dogma's portrayal as a being made of static tied to a television heavily implies that it represents the \"Christian broadcasts\" that Isaac's mother watches. This is further evidenced by the level transition that plays, showing Isaac watching the broadcasts with his mother.\n**Dogma could be interpreted as the Second Beast: [[wikipedia:The_Beast_(Revelation)|The Beast from the Earth]]. A popular interpretation of this beast is the \"False Prophet\".\n**The reason why Dogma may have a brimstone attack is the fact that Brimstone can also mean a style of Christian preaching that uses vivid descriptions of judgment and eternal damnation to encourage repentance, which is heavily implied to be what Isaac's Mom follows.\n*Dogma's theme is called [[Living in the Light (vocals)|\"Living in the Light\"]], and is taken directly from one of the many Bible quotes heard during the fight's second phase.\n**The vocals in \"Living in the Light\" are performed by [[RIDICULON|Matthias Bossi and Jon Evans]].\n**The OST version of \"Living in the Light\" plays unique vocals before playing the vocals from the in-game version.\n**The composition of the \"Living in the Light\" is very similar to Matricide, and shares motifs with tracks Genesis 22:10 and Crusade.\n**The vocals from \"Living in the Light\" can also be heard in the cutscene that plays prior to fighting The Beast.\n*During Dogma's first phase, a quiet recording of Psalm 23:1-4 can be heard. At the beginning of most of Dogma's attacks, this recording is temporarily made much louder.\n*Dogma is one of the two bosses that have a unique health bar, the other one being {{e|Great Gideon}}.\n*Dogma is the only boss to have a unique level transition and a unique Versus screen sound.\n*Most of Dogma's sprites appear blue in the files. This is because the blue is used to indicate areas that the game should apply the static effect to. This was likely done to avoid making all the sprite files animated, instead simply letting the game apply the effect to designated areas when the time comes to use them.\n*If the player uses {{I|Lodestone}} to magnetize Dogma or its TV, the respective sprite will become fuzzy, as if it's having a signal error.\n**{{I|Salvation}} will also distort Dogma's sprite while the beam of light is charging.\n**The same can be accomplished with {{i|Hemoptysis}}.\n*If a player defeats Dogma but dies during the Beast fight on the first time fighting Dogma, a unique save file state will appear, showing a Cross similar to the one in the cutscene between the two bosses.\n*Dogma has [[Cut_Content#Dogma.27s_Unused_Attacks|two unused attacks]] in the games files. It would have summon {{e|Angelic Baby|display=Angelic Babies}} and a Blackhole.\n*During the ''Repentance'' DLC's early development, Isaac was meant to fight a demonic doppleganger of himself, who would grow larger and stronger from every hit. This boss was scrapped and replaced by Dogma.<ref>https://twitter.com/edmundmcmillen/status/1442954444115636228</ref>\n*When at lower health in its second form, Dogma will transform into four random images for split seconds: Goat skull with a snake, a housefly, Isaac's face, and a grinning demon face. What these images really mean is unknown.\n*Edmund McMillen noted that Dogma, along with the [[Tainted Characters]] and The Beast sequence, were initially [https://twitter.com/edmundmcmillen/status/1487577680044195840 reserved for a possible Isaac sequel]. \n\n== Bugs ==\n{{Bug|If the player were to add Dogma into a room via Debug Console and defeat both phases, the cutscene with Isaac and The Beast will play as normal but the game will crash shortly after, due to a sequence break.}}\n{{Bug|If the player dies at the same time as killing Dogma's second phase and has extra lives that make him respawn outside of the room, the fight will reset to the start when entering the room again. The static transitioning effect that starts at the end of the fight will remain on the screen after reviving, making it very difficult to see anything during the rematch.}}\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n{{nav|boss}}\n\n[[Category:Home Bosses]]\n[[Category:Debut Bosses in Repentance]]",
