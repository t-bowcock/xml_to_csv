The Ludovico Technique,I329,Controlled tears,"Instead of firing tears, Isaac controls one floating tear that hover over obstacles. This tear deals constant damage when held in place over an enemy.",2,,"&emsp;- Instead of firing tears, Isaac controls one floating tear that hovers over obstacles. This tear deals constant damage when held in place over an enemy.<br>","&emsp;- (Removed in Repentance) The Ludovico Technique is a special item.<br>&emsp;- Ludovico tear is piercing and spectral by default.<br>&emsp;- Ludovico tear movement speed is determined by the shot speed stat.<br>&emsp;- Ludovico tear hits per second are determined by the tears stat, maxed out at 30 ticks per second.<br>&emsp;- When Death uses his The Hourglass attack, the tear is slow to respond but then moves so quickly that it is nearly impossible to use effectively.<br>&emsp;- (Removed in Repentance) When there are no enemies in a room, the tear slowly floats towards the player.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- The Brimstone ring still follows when the player is outside of it.<br>&emsp;- If multiple Ludovico Techniques are acquired (via Diplopia, Crooked Penny or on a victory lap), then additional smaller tears will orbit the main tear.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- A maximum of 15 smaller tears can orbit the main tear.<br>&emsp;- The Ludovico tear is larger than normal, but does not gain size from damage as much as normal tears.<br>",True
Cricket's Head,I4,DMG up,"Increases [[Damage]] by 0.5, and increases damage multiplier by x1.5.",4,,&emsp;- +0.5 Damage.<br>&emsp;- x1.5 Damage multiplier.<br>,"&emsp;- The x1.5 damage multiplier does not stack with the x1.5 damage multiplier from Magic Mushroom, from the combination of The Book of Belial and Blood of the Martyr, or itself (by using an item such as Diplopia, for example). However, it will stack with any other multipliers, such as Sacred Heart.<br>",True
Libra,I304,You feel balanced,"Gives 6 {{E|Penny|display=Coins}}, 6 {{E|bomb}}s, and 6 {{E|key}}s and balances out all [[attribute]]s.",1,,"&emsp;- Continually balances Isaac's primary attributes - damage, range, tears, and speed (has no effect on luck, shot speed, (Removed in Repentance) or tear falling speed).<br>&emsp;&emsp;- This effect is ''NOT'' one time only - Libra will rebalance Isaac's attributes whenever they are changed by an item, effect, etc. including temporary effects such as the The Book of Belial.<br>&emsp;- Grants 6 Penny|display=Coins, 6 bombs, and 6 keys.<br>","&emsp;- The balancing is based on Isaac as the character himself; he gains no bonuses or penalties to any stats from simply having Libra on its own.<br>&emsp;- The game calculates Isaac's speed, range, tear delay, and damage before using them in Libra's balancing formula. This has the following notable effects:<br>&emsp;&emsp;- (Removed in Repentance) If Isaac's Speed or Tear delay are already at their internal soft caps (2.00 and 5 respectively), items that increase them specifically will give no stats.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- The only exception would be items that decrease tear delay, and then only if Isaac's tear delay isn't at the hard cap of 1.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- (Added in Repentance) If Isaac's tears stat has reached the soft cap corresponding to 5 fire rate, basic tears ups no longer add bonuses, only direct tear delay upgrades will. Likewise, direct fire rate increases have no effect if the absolute maximum of 120 has been reached.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Speed adjustments, despite the stat being bounded between 0.1 and 2.0, always have an effect.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- {{Dlc|r}} Speed and range will positively scale as they increase; the higher these stats already are upon receiving a boost to either one, the bigger the boost to the rest of Isaac's stats. Range scales especially quickly, making large range upgrades like My Reflection and Tiny Planet very powerful with Libra.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- Items that apply multipliers to Isaac's tear delay (Mutant Spider, Brimstone, Dr. Fetus, etc.) can be fired more rapidly with less damage.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- Damage upgrades become less effective. In return, speed and range upgrades now increase damage and tears.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- Items that affect the stats of Isaac's tears after they're fired (A Lump of Coal, Blood Clot, Proptosis, etc.) do not go through the balancing formula and work as normal.<br>&emsp;- (Removed in Repentance) Libra's balancing formula values tear delay higher than the other stats and damage less than the other stats. This makes standard tears ups give more stats than a standard range or speed up, and standard damage ups give less stats than a standard range or speed up.<br>&emsp;- (Added in Repentance) Generally speaking, if an item increases Isaac's damage per second, Isaac will receive a stat bonus. If the item lowers fire rate and increases damage, or vice versa, in a way that results in loss of DPS, Isaac's stats will go down.<br>&emsp;- (Removed in Repentance) Since tear falling speed is not involved in the calculations, items such as Mini Mush or Kidney Stone that increase tear falling speed but lower range are mostly detrimental.<br>&emsp;- Stat upgrade pills have more utility, providing bonuses long after their stat could be usefully increased.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- In order of effectiveness, the pills are: ''Range'', ''Tears'', then ''Speed Up''.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- Placebo with stat upgrade pills provides a constant source of stat increases.<br>",True

Upon death, he will respawn in the most recent non-hostile room with full health, after which 1up! will disappear.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- If Isaac has no Red Heart Containers, he'll respawn with a Half Soul Heart instead.<br>&emsp;- The 1up! mushroom begins following Isaac like a familiar upon pickup, but doesn't do anything. It disappears when its life is used up.<br>&emsp;- {{transf|Fun Guy|item}}<br>",&emsp;- Resurrection items activate in a :Category:Revival items|set order. 1up! is (Removed in Repentance) 1st (Added in Repentance) 2nd in this order after Soul of Lazarus|n.<br>&emsp;- ??? / (Added in Repentance) Tainted ??? / Tainted Bethany / Tainted Forgotten will each respawn with 3 Soul Hearts.<br>&emsp;- {{dlc+|a+}} The Forgotten will respawn with 3 filled Bone Hearts and The Soul with whatever Soul and Black Hearts he had on death.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- Dying as The Soul respawns him with a Half Soul Heart and The Forgotten with whatever Bone Hearts he had on death.{{dlc-}}<br>&emsp;- (Added in Repentance) Dark Judas / Tainted Judas will respawn with 2 Black Hearts.<br>&emsp;- (Added in Repentance) Tainted Jacob will respawn in his ghost form if he had been turned into his ghost form before dying.<br>,True
20/20,I245,Double shot,"Isaac fires two tears at once, one from each eye.<br>{{dlc|r}} 0.75x [[damage]] multiplier.",4,,"&emsp;- Isaac fires two tears at once, one from each eye.<br>&emsp;- (Added in Repentance) 0.75x damage multiplier.<br>","&emsp;- Unlike other multiple shot items like Mutant Spider or The Inner Eye, 20/20 does not reduce the rate of fire.<br>&emsp;- The maximum amount of tears per volley that can be reached by combining and/or duplicating 20/20, The Inner Eye, Mutant Spider and The Wiz is 16, or 20 with the Keeper.<br>",True

This means that some bosses that might seem to finish their death animations after Isaac dies, such as (Removed in Repentance)Ultra Greed, will still be technically killed and will still give their completion marks, even if Isaac does not enter the Final Boss Chest.<br>&emsp;- Some bosses have special interactions with this item:<br>&emsp;&emsp;- Attempting to use this item to kill Delirium will not work. Its death animation is much longer than the time between using Plan C and Isaac's Last Will appearing, meaning Isaac will die first and it will not count as a kill.

In the case of Lazarus' Rags, though, the completion mark will go toward Lazarus and not the character originally selected.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Similarly, if playing as Tainted Lazarus, using Plan C and then using Flip to switch to the other form pauses the death counter until the player switches back to the form that originally used the item.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- It is possible to kill Delirium by carefully timing pauses after each screen static. Each screen static plays a cutscene that continues to play even while paused, so by pausing and unpausing at the right timings, Delirium's death animation can be shortened to just under 3 seconds allowing for his completion mark to be awarded.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- (Added in Repentance) Will not work if used against Ultra Greedier as Tainted Forgotten, The Lost, Tainted Lost, or Tainted Jacob in his lost form.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- (Added in Repentance) Killing Mother|n's second phase with Plan C will kill Isaac just at the end of her death animation.

Enough range upgrades can leave a large blind spot directly in front of the sword.<br>&emsp;- Only the projectile and spin attack are affected by tear rate, not the normal sword swing, meaning that items that increase damage but decrease tear rate, such as Polyphemus and Eve's Mascara, are much more effective when only using the swing. Additionally, items that do the inverse, such as Soy Milk and Almond Milk; are not as effective when only using the swing.<br>&emsp;- Spirit Sword will deflect Mother's Fistula attack and will send it right back at her, entering a short sequence that allows to deal bonus damage, if executed correctly; see this Mother#Phase 1|page for more details.<br>&emsp;- Spirit Sword is overridden by the Blindfolded effect, as seen while playing as Lilith or in challenges like {{chal|Cat Got Your Tongue}}.<br>&emsp;- Tainted Lilith: The sword is held by the fetus and acts the same way as with other characters.<br>&emsp;- Having 30 tears performs the swing attack automatically.<br>",True

As long as the sword hangs above Isaac, all item pedestals are doubled, spawning an additional free item next to them.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- Items spawned via other means, like Machines, Beggars, and certain items and Cards and Runes|cards, are also doubled.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- The extra item will be pulled from the current room's item pool, even if the original item is from a different pool (ex. Beggars or items from Alabaster Box).<br>&emsp;- After Isaac gets hit once with the item activated, at any time with only a brief warning, the sword may fall, instantly killing Isaac regardless of his health. The sword has a 1/10000 chance every 4 frames to fall, so on average, 50% of all Damocles runs will not drop the sword until after at least 15 minutes and 24 seconds have passed.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- Self-damage (such as from a {{Machine|Blood Donation Machine}}, {{Machine|Devil Beggar}}, Curse Room, Sacrifice Room, or self-damage Active Items) does not count as damage taken for Damocles, and will not give it the chance to fall.<br>","&emsp;- The chance for the sword to fall does not increase beyond the first hit taken.<br>&emsp;- Items from chests will not be doubled, which greatly limits Damocles' benefit in Chapters#Chapter 6 .28Optional.29|Chapter 6.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- The exception to this is Mega Chest|display=Mega Chests, which will spawn one extra item alongside the 2 original items for a total of 3 items.<br>&emsp;- In scenarios that have multiple items to choose from (such as rare double Treasure Room layouts and Boss Rush), an additional set of items for Isaac to choose from spawns. Only one item from each set can be taken.<br>&emsp;- Having multiple Damocles active at once does not spawn additional items.<br>&emsp;- The only way Isaac can survive the falling sword is if he's invincible at the time it falls or, by technicality, with a respawn item. After the sword falls, extra items will no longer spawn.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- Losing a life before the sword falls does not remove the sword or its threat.<br>&emsp;- Items with associated costs, like those in Devil Room or Shop, will not create additional items. This severely limits this item's benefit when used as Tainted Keeper, since most items that are normally created as pedestals are instead Shop items.<br>&emsp;- This can cause items that are in inaccessible spots in certain room layouts to be moved to a more convenient location due to not having space for two pedestals in that spot.<br>",True

It will swing its bone club 1.5 times per second. It can also interact with pickups using the bone club.<br>&emsp;- Minisaacs for Tainted Forgotten will spawn from The Forgotten's body and inherit its skin color but they will shoot regular tears.<br>&emsp;- Familiars spawned for Azazel or Tainted Azazel will not inherit the Brimstone laser and will fire regular tears.<br>&emsp;- If Isaac has any form of flight, the Minisaacs will receive wings and will be able to fly as well.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- Minisaacs spawned before flight was acquired will not get upgraded, unless the flight is acquired by killing Dogma and starting The Beast fight in which case they will get upgraded.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- Minisaacs that acquire temporary flight (e.g. from The Bible) will remain permanently upgraded until they die, even after the effect of The Bible expires.<br>&emsp;- There's an unused Shadow-like Minisaac that looks like it should be spawned from Dark Judas, but this isn't the case.<br>",True

This effectively negates any current-room effects from consumables, such as XV - The Devil or Rune of Algiz, during that period, as Isaac is teleported after they activate.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- Similarly, it is also advised to avoid using unidentified pills, as Isaac runs the risk of activating either a stat down or Telepills for the next three consumables he uses.<br>&emsp;- When obtained on Tainted Lazarus, Echo Chamber will only duplicate the last three cards or pills previously used on the Lazarus state with Echo Chamber. As a result, teleport cards or Telepills can be freely used on the Lazarus state without Echo Chamber.<br>&emsp;- If this item is somehow removed and reobtained during the run (such as when obtained from Lemegeton or Modeling Clay), the last three consumable types used during the time Isaac had Echo Chamber will be remembered.

That means using Blank Card, Placebo, or Clear Rune will not trigger Echo Chamber.<br>&emsp;- While Cracked Key will activate the effect of Echo Chamber and trigger the last three consumables used, using a different consumable near a wall that a red room could be created on will not create a red room, even if a Cracked Key has been used before.<br>&emsp;- Getting automatically revived by Soul of Lazarus does not add it to the queue, and directly using the soul stone will not allow you to get automatically revived in the future.<br>",True

Touching either of these on a floor that would not normally spawn them will instantly end the run and send the player back to the title screen (unless a challenge is currently being played, in which case the player will receive unlocks as if they had completed the challenge normally).
